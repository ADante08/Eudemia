   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
  </p>
  <p>
   First and foremost, I thank the members of my dissertation committee for their
  </p>
  <p>
   guidance, comments, insights, and encouragement: Konstantinos Kapparis, Eleni
  </p>
  <p>
   Bozia, Jennifer A. Rea, and Mary A. Watt. I would like to express my deep appreciation
  </p>
  <p>
   to my adviser Konstantinos Kapparis for his enthusiasm and support for this project in
  </p>
  <p>
   neo-Latin literature and Classical reception; it has been a dream come true to combine
  </p>
  <p>
   my scholarly interests in Latin, Italian, Rome, and books. I thank Laurent Mayali,
  </p>
  <p>
   director of the Robbins Collection at the UC Berkeley School of Law, for encouraging
  </p>
  <p>
   my pursuit of this degree. Additionally, I would like to thank my professors at the
  </p>
  <p>
   University of Kentucky: Terence Tunberg for bringing Eudemia to my attention; Jennifer
  </p>
  <p>
   Morrish Tunberg for sharing her expertise in the neo-Latin novel; Jane Phillips for
  </p>
  <p>
   fostering my interest in Erasmus; and Milena Minkova, whose words never rang so true
  </p>
  <p>
   for me as during this project: “Non vertimus ut intellegamus; intellegimus ut vertamus.” I
  </p>
  <p>
   also thank my professors at UCLA for introducing me to the world of neo-Latin: Michael
  </p>
  <p>
   J. B. Allen, Bernard Frischer, Carlo Ginzburg, and Debora Shuger. I especially want to
  </p>
  <p>
   express my heartfelt and humble thanks to Mark T. Riley, whose linguistic skill and keen
  </p>
  <p>
   editorial eye helped me out of quite a few tight spots with my Latin. His generosity and
  </p>
  <p>
   kindness in lending his time and expertise to my draft was far more than I, a complete
  </p>
  <p>
   stranger to him, could have possibly expected. I would like to thank my parents: Alan H.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nelson for instilling in me a love of Latin and books, and my late mother, Judith Anne
  </p>
  <p>
   Manes Nelson for filling our home with music and languages. Finally, I express my
  </p>
  <p>
   gratitude to Oscar Luca D’Amore, my husband and partner in Latin, life, and love.

   Gian Vittorio Rossi, who wrote under the pseudonym Ianus Nicius Erythraeus,
  </p>
  <p>
   lived from 1577 to 1647. An active participant in the intellectual and artistic community
  </p>
  <p>
   orbiting in Rome around Pope Urban VIII and the powerful Barberini family, his prolific
  </p>
  <p>
   literary output encompassed many genres, including letters, dialogues, orations,
  </p>
  <p>
   biographies, poetry, and fiction. A superlative Latinist, Rossi unleashed his biting wit
  </p>
  <p>
   and deep knowledge of Classical literature against perceived societal wrongs. Set in the
  </p>
  <p>
   fictional time and place of first-century AD Rome, Eudemiae libri VIII is a satirical novel
  </p>
  <p>
   that criticizes Rossi’s own society for its system of patronage and favors that he saw as
  </p>
  <p>
   rewarding wealth and opulence over skill and hard work. An understudied figure,
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s involvement with one of Rome’s premier literary academies, his relationships
  </p>
  <p>
   with intellectuals both in Italy and all over Europe, and his literary output, which was
  </p>
  <p>
   almost exclusively in Latin, provide a unique and different insider perspective on
  </p>
  <p>
   Baroque Rome, a period known mostly for its painting, sculpture, architecture, and
  </p>
  <p>
   literature in the vernacular.

   CHAPTER 1
  </p>
  <p>
   INTRODUCTION
  </p>
  <p>
   Gian Vittorio Rossi and Eudemiae libri VIII
  </p>
  <p>
   Gian Vittorio Rossi had an ax to grind. His Eudemiae libri VIII tells the story of
  </p>
  <p>
   Flavius Vopiscus Niger and Paulus Aemilius Verus, who escape from Rome in the
  </p>
  <p>
   aftermath of the Conspiracy of Sejanus and become shipwrecked on Eudemia, an
  </p>
  <p>
   island located off the coast of Mauritania. They are rescued by a fellow Roman named
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius, who becomes their guide. The two travelers discover a society of Latin
  </p>
  <p>
   speakers that is governed by a class of people called dynastae, administered by
  </p>
  <p>
   incompetent senators (called poliarchi) and magistrates, where petty rivalries thrive,
  </p>
  <p>
   hard work and skill are trumped by personal relationships and favors, and where, as
  </p>
  <p>
   Luisella Giachino puts it, everything revolves around “la sinistra onnipresenza e
  </p>
  <p>
   onnipotenza del denaro” (“the sinister omnipresence and omnipotence of money”).1
  </p>
  <p>
   Writing under the pseudonym Ianus Nicius Erythraeus, Rossi brought to bear his vast
  </p>
  <p>
   knowledge of ancient authors, his acerbic wit, and his mastery of Latin to weave a tale
  </p>
  <p>
   that, despite its fictional time and place, is a mordent critique of his own society: Rome
  </p>
  <p>
   under the reign of Pope Urban VIII and the powerful Barberini family.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is clear both from his own writings and from contemporary assessments of his
  </p>
  <p>
   talent that Rossi was well read, witty, and, above all, an excellent Latinist. He was a
  </p>
  <p>
   founding member of the Accademia degli Umoristi, an influential literary academy that
  </p>
  <p>
   attracted intellectuals from all over Europe and was frequented by Rome’s high society,
  </p>
  <p>
   including Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII. Rossi hoped that his education, skills,
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   and connections would lead to a fruitful career in the Roman Curia, but this never came
  </p>
  <p>
   to fruition. After a life of professional frustration, spent on the margins of Rome’s elite
  </p>
  <p>
   society, Rossi retired to a private life of reading and writing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the literary products of his retirement years was Eudemia, described by
  </p>
  <p>
   Luigi Gerboni as a “sfogo di vecchi rancori” (“a venting of old grudges”).2 The 1637
  </p>
  <p>
   publication date of Eudemiae libri VIII places it squarely within what Jennifer Morrish
  </p>
  <p>
   calls the “golden age of the neo-Latin novel.”3 As Mark T. Riley explains, examples of
  </p>
  <p>
   extended Latin prose fiction in the vein of Apuleius’s Metamorphoses or Petronius’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Satyricon were rare until the early seventeenth century, when John Barclay published
  </p>
  <p>
   Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon (Parisiis: Huby, 1605).4 Following Barclay’s satire,
  </p>
  <p>
   2 Gerboni 1899: 108.
  </p>
  <p>
   3 Morrish 2003: 238. While Eudemia is frequently classified under the broad category of novel (IJsewijn
  </p>
  <p>
   1995: 91; IJsewijn and Sacré 1998: 255; Giachino 2002: 187; Riley 2015: 196; Marsh 2015: 404), it is
  </p>
  <p>
   also described using various generic subcategories: satirical novel (Tilg 2017: 332); roman à clef (Drujon
  </p>
  <p>
   1966: 1052-7; Gryphius 1710: 491-6; Kytzler 1982: 204; De Smet 1996: 76-7; Hofman 1999: 11);
  </p>
  <p>
   Menippean satire (De Smet 1996: 76; ibid. 2015: 204; IJsewijn 1988: 237; ibid. 1995: 91); and utopia (Tilg
  </p>
  <p>
   2017: 332; De Smet 1996: 76; Kytzler 1982: 204; Gott and Begley 1902: 361). The utopian genre merits
  </p>
  <p>
   further comment. Whereas Thomas More’s 1516 Utopia narrates a voyage to an ideal land, the voyage
  </p>
  <p>
   narrated in Eudemia is from a corrupt land to an even more corrupt land. The protagonists flee Rome in
  </p>
  <p>
   the aftermath of the attempted overthrow of the emperor Tiberius, whose craven reputation was
  </p>
  <p>
   immortalized by such authors as Tacitus and Suetonius. Even in comparison to Rome under Tiberius,
  </p>
  <p>
   however, the island of Eudemia finds itself on the losing side in terms of wantonness, causing the narrator
  </p>
  <p>
   at one point to exclaim, “Vah . . . Qui cultus! Quae luxuries! At Romae nemo senator, nemo consul, ac ne
  </p>
  <p>
   Tiberius quidem . . . hujus opulentiae luxu decoratur” (“What elegance! What luxury! In Rome no senator,
  </p>
  <p>
   consul, or even Tiberius himself, adorns himself with the trappings of such wealth!”). This is why Kytzler
  </p>
  <p>
   (1982: 204) places the work on the periphery of the utopian genre. This nonutopian aspect of Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   has often been misunderstood. According to Gerboni (1899: 133-4), both Gabriel Naudé and Burkhard
  </p>
  <p>
   Struve considered Eudemia a utopian novel. In fact, Gerboni cites a letter from Naudé to Rossi (Epistolae
  </p>
  <p>
   1667: 699), in which the French humanist makes a direct comparison between Eudemia and More’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Utopia: “tuo forsan vel Mori suo exemplo ductus Eudemiam aliquam, Utopiamve fingere voluit.” He also
  </p>
  <p>
   cites a passage from Naudé’s Additions et Corrections au Naudaeana et Patiniana (1703: 147) in which
  </p>
  <p>
   Naudé describes Eudemia as a “république bien policée” (“a well-run republic”). Additionally, in the
  </p>
  <p>
   bibliography following his translation of Samuel Gott’s Nova Solyma, Walter Begley (1902: 361) lists
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia under the category “Utopian Romance of an Ideal City or State.”

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   which, like Petronius’s Satyricon, was “full of lively incident and satirical descriptions of
  </p>
  <p>
   contemporary people and institutions,”5 Rossi unleashed his arsenal of learning and wit
  </p>
  <p>
   against his contemporaries with full awareness of his ancient and modern generic
  </p>
  <p>
   predecessors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemiae libri VIII is at once an entertaining tour de force of Classical erudition
  </p>
  <p>
   and an intimately personal introduction to his own circle. As Giachino explains,
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia’s plot is secondary to “quello che oggi chiameremmo il ‘gossip,’ il martellante e
  </p>
  <p>
   vischioso pettegolezzo che anima e coinvolge tutti i personaggi”6 (“what today we would
  </p>
  <p>
   call ‘gossip,’ the incessant and vicious scuttlebutt that animates and involves all of the
  </p>
  <p>
   characters”). Rossi becomes our guide—our Gallonius—as he introduces us to his
  </p>
  <p>
   friends, lets us in on the debates of the day, and airs his grievances with a society that
  </p>
  <p>
   admired him but never completely embraced him.
  </p>
  <p>
   State of Scholarship on Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite his prolific literary output, his active correspondence with friends in high
  </p>
  <p>
   places, the reputation he enjoyed as a Latinist among his contemporaries, and his
  </p>
  <p>
   continued fame in Northern Europe, particularly in Germany, for more than a century
  </p>
  <p>
   after his death,7 Gian Vittorio Rossi remains a largely unexplored figure in Italian
  </p>
  <p>
   literature. Luigi Gerboni, the nineteenth-century scholar who wrote the most extensive
  </p>
  <p>
   biography of Rossi, lamented that this Roman author had been all but ignored even by
  </p>
  <p>
   2014; De Smet 2015: 199-214; Riley 2015: 183-97; Glomski and Moreau 2016; Marsh 2017: 308-21;
  </p>
  <p>
   Relihan 2017: 340-57; Tilg 2017: 322-39.

  </p>
  <p>
   Italian scholars: “la critica nostra l’ha dimenticata, o meglio non l’ha mai conosciuta”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“our literary critics have forgotten him, or rather, they have never known him”)8;
  </p>
  <p>
   likewise, Benedetto Croce remarked that, unfortunately, nobody showed any interest in
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s works (“ora nessuno lo cerca”).9 The most recent and thorough analysis of
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia is Luisella Giachino’s 2002 article, “Cicero libertinus: La satira della Roma

   work and discusses its major themes. Giachino also authored the recent entry for Rossi

  </p>
  <p>
   Though the literature specifically on Gian Vittorio Rossi and his works is slight,
  </p>
  <p>
   interest in neo-Latin literature in general has happily been increasing. In the 1970s
  </p>
  <p>
   Jozef IJsewijn observed that, with regards to scholarly work on neo-Latin authors of the
  </p>
  <p>
   sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, “almost everything remains to be done.”11 Thirty
  </p>
  <p>
   years later, the scholarly status of neo-Latin authors had not changed much when
  </p>
  <p>
   Jennifer Morrish remarked that they were “little known today and not much read”
  </p>
  <p>
   because, among other things, most of the texts are available only in their original Latin
  </p>
  <p>
   and do not exist in modern editions.”12 More recently, there has been significant
  </p>
  <p>
   progress in creating new editions of neo-Latin texts, notably the I Tatti Renaissance
  </p>
  <p>
   Library (Harvard University Press), the Bibliotheca Latinitatis Novae’s “Neo-Latin Texts
  </p>
  <p>
   and Translation” series (Leuven University Press), the NeoLatina series (Tübingen:

  </p>
  <p>
   authors such as Christopher Celenza, Ingrid De Smet, David Marsh, David Porter, Joel
  </p>
  <p>
   Relihan, Mark T. Riley, Dirk Sacré, and Stephan Tilg, as well as new reference works
  </p>
  <p>
   such as Brill’s Encyclopedia of the Neo-Latin World, the Oxford Handbook of Neo-Latin,
  </p>
  <p>
   and the Guide to Neo-Latin Literature from Cambridge University Press, have been
  </p>
  <p>
   instrumental in bringing ever greater scholarly attention to neo-Latin literature. Gian
  </p>
  <p>
   Vittorio Rossi, however, has still largely been ignored, his works usually mentioned only
  </p>
  <p>
   in passing as part of a larger list of neo-Latin authors and texts.13
  </p>
  <p>
   Factors that contributed to Rossi’s near obscurity include the fact that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   writing in Latin at a time when vernacular languages were ascending in Europe as the
  </p>
  <p>
   principal vehicle for literary expression and exchange of ideas; none of his work was
  </p>
  <p>
   ever translated into any language for a broader reading public;14 and, in the case of
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia, readers over the centuries may have lost interest in the satire because it was
  </p>
  <p>
   too tied to Rossi’s own circle of acquaintances thus “los[ing] referential power over
  </p>
  <p>
   time,” as Dustin Griffin explains.15
  </p>
  <p>
   13 IJsewijn mentions Eudemia briefly in the chapter on long novels in his Companion to Neo-Latin Studies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In his article titled “Latin Literature in 17th-century Rome,” IJsewijn discusses the author and his work
  </p>
  <p>
   within the artistic and intellectual milieu of Rome under the Urban VIII Barberini. The Oxford Handbook of
  </p>
  <p>
   Neo-Latin mentions Rossi four times, briefly: In the chapter titled “Fiction,” Riley describes Eudemia as “a
  </p>
  <p>
   satire on seventeenth-century Rome written in beautiful Latin” (196); in the chapter titled “Satire,” De
  </p>
  <p>
   Smet identifies it as a Menippean satire that paints “a detailed, if rather disjointed, portrait of Rome under
  </p>
  <p>
   the papacy of Urban VIII” (206); and Marsh, in the chapter titled “Italy,” makes this perplexing statement:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Emblematically, in the mid-seventeenth century, Gian Vittorio Rossi chose to set his Latin novel Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   (1645) in the age of Tiberius, and therefore could describe none of the baroque splendor or modern
  </p>
  <p>
   mores of contemporary Rome” (404).

  </p>
  <p>
   13
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s works deserve further scholarly attention both on their own merits and
  </p>
  <p>
   because they provide a window into the dynamic cultural period in which he lived. Rossi
  </p>
  <p>
   was an insider witness to seventeenth-century Rome, a period Jozef IJsewijn
  </p>
  <p>
   characterized as “a thriving center of Latin literature on an international scale.”16 His
  </p>
  <p>
   literary output was prolific and encompassed many genres, including letters, dialogues,
  </p>
  <p>
   orations, biographies, poetry, and, of course, fiction. Last but not least, his works are
  </p>
  <p>
   highly enjoyable to read because his personality—at times witty, incisive, pious, and
  </p>
  <p>
   caustic—comes through on almost every page.
  </p>
  <p>
   Life of Gian Vittorio Rossi
  </p>
  <p>
   Gian Vittorio Rossi was born in 1577 in Rome to a family that he describes as
  </p>
  <p>
   noble but not wealthy: “[P]otes . . . breviter respondere me esse bono genere ortum,
  </p>
  <p>
   bonis prognatum, modicis facultatibus” (“The short answer is that I come from a good
  </p>
  <p>
   family and am descended from noble people of modest means”).17 He had a younger
  </p>
  <p>
   brother, Andrea, and a younger sister whom he never mentions by name.18 Rossi was
  </p>
  <p>
   educated at the Jesuit Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University),
  </p>
  <p>
   where he was a pupil of such teachers as Bernardino Stefoni and Francesco Benci, the
  </p>
  <p>
   16 IJsewijn 1995: 78.
  </p>
  <p>
   17 Dialog. sept. XIII (Prefatory letter, addressed to Vaius Vaius). See also Gerboni 1899: 7-8. The most
  </p>
  <p>
   thorough source of information on Rossi’s life and works is Gerboni’s Un umanista nel secento, Giano
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicio Eritreo (Città di Castello: S. Lapi, 1899). Gerboni draws his information primarily from Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   published letters (Epistolae ad diversos, vols. 1 &amp; 2 and Epistolae ad Tyrrhenum, vols. 1 &amp; 2) as well as
  </p>
  <p>
   his book of dialogues (Dialogi septendecim), in particular the thirteenth dialogue, in which Rossi gives a
  </p>
  <p>
   first-person account of his life. In addition, a few vignettes in Eudemia are thought to be inspired by
  </p>
  <p>
   events in Rossi’s own life. Another source is Johann Christian Fischer’s “Vita Ioannis Victorii Rossi sive
  </p>
  <p>
   Iani Nicii Erythraei,” which he includes in his Epistolae ad Tyrrhenum et ad diversos, though Gerboni
  </p>
  <p>
   criticizes Fischer’s overly encomiastic portrayal of Rossi, remarking that Fischer’s view of the Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   author reflects the high regard that German and other Northern European scholars had for Rossi in the
  </p>
  <p>
   seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   latter a student of the French humanist Marc Antoine Muret, one of the greatest Latinists
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Renaissance. When Rossi was seventeen years old his father died, and his
  </p>
  <p>
   family was placed in a precarious financial state exacerbated by his brother Andrea’s
  </p>
  <p>
   penchant for making bad business investments and defaulting on loans, which resulted
  </p>
  <p>
   in the loss of the family’s good name among creditors.19 Finding himself, as the eldest
  </p>
  <p>
   son, in the position of head of household, Rossi studied law with the hope that such a
  </p>
  <p>
   degree would lead to an administrative position within the papal court. He completed his
  </p>
  <p>
   degree in Roman and canon law in 1596 at the age of nineteen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s professional future seemed bright at first when, upon finishing his degree,
  </p>
  <p>
   he caught the attention of an individual whom he does not name but describes as “longe
  </p>
  <p>
   doctissimus atque clarissimus insigni magistratu praeditus” (“the most learned and
  </p>
  <p>
   famous by far and occupying an important judicial office”), and he was offered a position
  </p>
  <p>
   coveted by many young professionals “propter honorem atque utilitatem” (“because it
  </p>
  <p>
   was honorable and well paid”).20 Rossi held this post for little more than a year, when
  </p>
  <p>
   this patron died suddenly, leaving him without employment. He soon entered an
  </p>
  <p>
   apprenticeship in contract law under the renowned lawyer Lepido Piccolomini, but this
  </p>
  <p>
   mentor died after only a few years.21
  </p>
  <p>
   19 The last trace we have of Andrea is in Palermo in 1603-4, where he was in the service of the Cardinal
  </p>
  <p>
   of Monreale in Sicily (Gerboni 1899: 12).
  </p>
  <p>
   20 Rossi never provides this individual’s name. This and the other details of his early career that follow are
  </p>
  <p>
   described in his 1632 letter to Guilelmus Moonsius (Ep. ad div. 1.IV.II).
  </p>
  <p>
   21 Ep. ad div. 1.IV.II; see also Gerboni 1899: 14.
  </p>
  <p>
   15
  </p>
  <p>
   Following Piccolomini’s death, and after several attempts to enter into the service
  </p>
  <p>
   of one cardinal or another,22 Rossi became generally disillusioned with the law. He
  </p>
  <p>
   withdrew to a house on the Janiculum Hill and devoted himself to humanistic studies.23
  </p>
  <p>
   In one of his autobiographical dialogues he explicitly expressed, in the persona of an
  </p>
  <p>
   interlocutor named Nicius, his preference for ancient Roman authors over the jurists and
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman law glossators such as Accursius and Bartolus of Saxoferrato, whose writings
  </p>
  <p>
   would have been an integral part of his legal studies: “multoque libentius Plautum,
  </p>
  <p>
   Terentium, Ciceronem, Caesarem sumebam in manus quam Accursium, Bartolum,
  </p>
  <p>
   ceterosque auctores” (“I much preferred reading the works of Plautus, Terence, Cicero,
  </p>
  <p>
   and Caesar to those of Accursius, Bartolus, and authors of their ilk”).24
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1600s, when Rossi was turning away from the law to focus on
  </p>
  <p>
   the liberal arts, he began attending meetings of the Accademia degli Umoristi
  </p>
  <p>
   (Academia Humoristarum), a literary society frequented by the most celebrated writers,
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars, and artists in Rome.25 The academy originated as a loose association of
  </p>
  <p>
   22 Employment under Domenico Pinelli and Ludovico de Torres, the younger (archbishop of Monreale in
  </p>
  <p>
   Palermo) were two possibilities that never came to fruition (Gerboni 1899: 17).
  </p>
  <p>
   23 This refuge from the city center would become a recurring image in his works. For example, a poem
  </p>
  <p>
   appended to a 1643 letter to Fabio Chigi (Ep. ad Tyrr. 1.XLIII) includes these lines: “Est mihi Janiculi
  </p>
  <p>
   domus alto in vertice collis / Quamvis parva, tamen qua non formosior ulla” (“I have a house at the top of
  </p>
  <p>
   Janiculum Hill that, though small, is more beautiful than anything”).
  </p>
  <p>
   24 Dialog. sept. XIII.
  </p>
  <p>
   25 The origin story of the Accademia degli Umoristi is told more or less consistently in both contemporary
  </p>
  <p>
   and modern sources: In 1600, during the period of Carnival, a group of literary-minded friends of the
  </p>
  <p>
   nobleman Paolo Mancini gathered at Palazzo Mancini, his home located in the Via del Corso in Rome, on
  </p>
  <p>
   the occasion of his wedding to Vittoria Capozzi. They entertained themselves by improvising and reciting
  </p>
  <p>
   comedies, sonnets, and speeches on various diverting topics. The group decided to keep meeting every
  </p>
  <p>
   eight days to continue this literary activity, and they came to be known as the Belli Humori. When the
  </p>
  <p>
   group formally incorporated in 1608, they adopted the name Accademia degli Umoristi (Maylender and
  </p>
  <p>
   Rava 1976, vol. 5: 370-4; Russo 1979: 47-61; Alemanno 1995: 97-9).
  </p>
  <p>
   16
  </p>
  <p>
   writers, but it incorporated in 1608, at which point formal rules were established,26 and
  </p>
  <p>
   an official emblem was adopted depicting the sun partially obscured by precipitating
  </p>
  <p>
   clouds, accompanied by the Lucretian motto “redit agmine dulci.”27 The name of the
  </p>
  <p>
   academy, the Umoristi (humorists), stems from their main activity, which was, at least
  </p>
  <p>
   initially, writing and performing comic plays in the style of ancient playwrights such as
  </p>
  <p>
   Plautus and Terence. Over time the Umoristi added more poetry and prose to their
  </p>
  <p>
   repertoire. The academy boasted many well-known Italian poets as its Principe, or
  </p>
  <p>
   head, including Alessandro Tassoni (elected in 1606),28 Gian Battista Guarini (elected in
  </p>
  <p>
   1611), and Giambattista Marino (elected in 1623).
  </p>
  <p>
   Membership in the Umoristi was not limited to Rome’s elite; in fact, the rules
  </p>
  <p>
   stated that membership was open to any persons who were “ritenute degne per nobilità
  </p>
  <p>
   di sangue, per letteratura non mediocre, o per eccellenza di qualche artefitio spettabile”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“considered worthy based on their nobility of blood, their superior literary abilities, or for
  </p>
  <p>
   excellence in any respectable art form”).29 That being said, from its very beginning the
  </p>
  <p>
   academy did attract members of Rome’s most important families such as the Colonna
  </p>
  <p>
   and the Barberini. One of its most prominent members was that most famous Barberini,
  </p>
  <p>
   Maffeo—Jesuit educated and a recognized neo-Latin poet—who in 1623 became Pope
  </p>
  <p>
   Urban VIII. It was thanks to Urban VIII and the powerful Barberini family that the
  </p>
  <p>
   26 The academy’s rules can be found in an appendix to Russo 1979: 58-61. Signatories to the rules
  </p>
  <p>
   (including Rossi) are listed in Maylender and Rava 1976, vol. 5: 375-80.
  </p>
  <p>
   27 Gerboni 1899: 16; Maylender and Rava 1976, vol. 5: 375-80.
  </p>
  <p>
   28 The Accademia degli Umoristi, along with many of its members who also appear in Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinacotheca and under pseudonyms in his Eudemia, are mentioned in Tassoni’s mock-epic poem La
  </p>
  <p>
   secchia rapita (XV.41): Gaspare Salviani, Paolo Mancini, Virginio Cesarini, Enrico Falconio, Carlo Mazzei
  </p>
  <p>
   (also known as Carlo a Sant’Antonio di Padova), and Pietro Sforza Pallavicino.
  </p>
  <p>
   29 Alemanno 1995: 99.
  </p>
  <p>
   17
  </p>
  <p>
   Umoristi, along with the scientific Accademia dei Lincei and the Jesuit Collegio Romano,
  </p>
  <p>
   became a driving cultural force in the seventeenth century, not just in Rome, but
  </p>
  <p>
   throughout Europe.30 Historian Marc Fumaroli refers to Urban VIII as “Cicero pontifex
  </p>
  <p>
   maximus” (Pope Cicero), explaining that neo-Latin literature experienced its second
  </p>
  <p>
   great Renaissance under his influence.31
  </p>
  <p>
   Through his participation in the Umoristi, Rossi came in contact with, as Gerboni
  </p>
  <p>
   puts it, “il fior della cittadinanza” (“the flower of Rome’s citizenry”) and gained respect for
  </p>
  <p>
   his literary and linguistic abilities.32 The writers, scholars, and intellectuals he met
  </p>
  <p>
   through the academy became the basis for many of the biographical profiles included in
  </p>
  <p>
   his Pinacotheca imaginum illustrium, but also fodder for the characters in his satire
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia. This includes, most prominently, a description of an academy meeting in
  </p>
  <p>
   Book Three where Eudemia’s intellectual elites gather to recite their poetry. It is also
  </p>
  <p>
   because of his participation in the Umoristi that Rossi became acquainted with Fabio
  </p>
  <p>
   Chigi (later Pope Alexander VII), who would become his most important friend and
  </p>
  <p>
   correspondent, as well as being an instrumental factor in his eventual publishing
  </p>
  <p>
   success.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a 1646 letter to the Dutch scholar Guilelmus Moonsius, Rossi credited his
  </p>
  <p>
   reputation as a Latinist for the fact that, around 1607, he was offered a position in the
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman Curia, explaining that Marcello Vestrio, Secretary of Latin Briefs under Pope
  </p>
  <p>
   30 Ibid.: 99-100.
  </p>
  <p>
   31 Fumaroli 1978: 797-835. The academy itself continued until 1717, but its major cultural impact was felt
  </p>
  <p>
   during Urban VIII’s papacy (1623 to 1644), the period during which Rossi was an active member
  </p>
  <p>
   (Alemanno 1995: 99-100).
  </p>
  <p>
   32 Gerboni 1899: 16.
  </p>
  <p>
   18
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul V, had been impressed after hearing Rossi declaim at an academy meeting.33 In
  </p>
  <p>
   the same letter, Rossi informed Moonsius that (by his own estimation) he made quite a
  </p>
  <p>
   name for himself in that job, remarking that “quicquid paulo limatius elegantiusque ex
  </p>
  <p>
   Vestrii domo prodibat, illud omnes meo praesertim ingenio industriaque perfectum
  </p>
  <p>
   elaboratumque existimabant esse” (“whenever anything more polished or elegant was
  </p>
  <p>
   issued by Vestrio’s office, everyone reckoned that it had been executed and worked on
  </p>
  <p>
   largely thanks to my ingenuity and effort”). This job lasted only eight months, however,
  </p>
  <p>
   before Vestrio took ill and died.
  </p>
  <p>
   Around 1608, Rossi received a firm job offer as secretary to Cardinal Giovanni
  </p>
  <p>
   Mellini, who had been appointed papal legate to Germany, but that would have meant
  </p>
  <p>
   relocating to another country and away from his beloved Rome. As it turned out, he got
  </p>
  <p>
   as far as the town of Caprarola (about forty miles north of Rome), came down with a
  </p>
  <p>
   fever, and had to be sent home. He never was able to secure a permanent position
  </p>
  <p>
   within the Church. Rossi blamed his difficulty in securing permanent employment on the
  </p>
  <p>
   fact that individuals in positions of power purposefully kept him out because they were
  </p>
  <p>
   jealous of, and intimidated by, his superior abilities.34
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s longest period of employment lasted from 1610 to 1623, when he served
  </p>
  <p>
   as the private secretary to Cardinal Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto.35 Rossi
  </p>
  <p>
   33 Ibid.: 19; see also Ep. ad div. 1.IV.II.
  </p>
  <p>
   34 Ibid.; see also Ep. ad div. 1.IV.II.
  </p>
  <p>
   35 There is some question as to how long Rossi was in Peretti’s employ. According to Gerboni (1899: 25),
  </p>
  <p>
   Peretti died August 3, 1628, but his death date was in fact June 2, 1623 (DBI). Gerboni calculates that
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi began working for the cardinal in 1610, disputing the 1608 date given by Jean Pierre Niceron
  </p>
  <p>
   (1736: 227-8). Gerboni bases his calculation on Rossi’s own statement regarding the length of time he
  </p>
  <p>
   worked for Peretti—which was either eighteen years (“illos duodeviginti annos . . . ei navaverim operam,”
  </p>
  <p>
   Dialog. sept. XIII) or twenty years (“viginti enim annis inanissimis officiis [aula] me implicitum
  </p>
  <p>
   occupatumque detinuit,” Ep. ad div. 2.VIII.VI)—and subtracting that from what he believed was Peretti’s
  </p>
  <p>
   death date of 1628. Since Peretti died in 1623, however, either Rossi began working for Peretti in 1603 or
  </p>
  <p>
   19
  </p>
  <p>
   characterized this as a low point in his life, during which he spent more than a decade
  </p>
  <p>
   doing a thankless job for a thankless employer. In a 1637 letter to Ugo Ubaldini, for
  </p>
  <p>
   example, Rossi describes Peretti as “inhumanissimus” (“extremely heartless”) because
  </p>
  <p>
   he not only had to pay for medical care out of his own pocket when he fell ill while in
  </p>
  <p>
   Peretti’s employ, but Peretti never even asked after him to see if he needed anything.36
  </p>
  <p>
   In Eudemia Peretti makes a memorable appearance as a nobleman named Plusius, an
  </p>
  <p>
   inattentive, unappreciative, and miserly boss to a long-suffering and overworked
  </p>
  <p>
   secretary named Nicius Rufus.37
  </p>
  <p>
   After Peretti’s death in 1623, Rossi retreated into private life, moving to a house
  </p>
  <p>
   in the Monte Mario neighborhood in the early 1630s where he spent the rest of his days.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no evidence of his having steady employment after that, though Gerboni
  </p>
  <p>
   assumes that he enjoyed some level of financial stability, since he was able to donate
  </p>
  <p>
   funds for the construction of a small church on Monte Mario dedicated to Santa Maria
  </p>
  <p>
   della Febbre, which he left as a bequest to the monastery of Sant’Onofrio (it still exists
  </p>
  <p>
   today as the Chiesa della Madonna del Rosario).38 In addition, sometime before 1630
  </p>
  <p>
   he had purchased an honorary office with the title Commissioner of the Aqua Marrana,
  </p>
  <p>
   1605, while he was still employed elsewhere, or his statement about working for eighteen or twenty years
  </p>
  <p>
   was rhetorical and simply meant “a long time.”

   37 Rossi’s true feelings toward his noble employer are difficult to ascertain. On the one hand, he
  </p>
  <p>
   composed a laudatory poem (included in Ep. ad div. 1.IV.XXVI) titled “In obitum Alexandri Peretti
  </p>
  <p>
   Cardinalis Montalti” (“On the occasion of the death of Cardinal Alessandro Peretti di Montalto”), in which
  </p>
  <p>
   he refers to Peretti as “Ille insignis Alexander et inclytus / qua sol surgit et occidit” (“that remarkable and
  </p>
  <p>
   renowned Alexander on whom the sun rose and set”). On the other hand, Rossi repurposed this very
  </p>
  <p>
   same poem in Book Four of Eudemia, where it is recited at the funeral procession of a nobleman named
  </p>
  <p>
   Alexander, at the conclusion of which the narrator tempers his praise by commenting that the nobleman
  </p>
  <p>
   had actually won the love of the populace more because of his philanthropy than because he boasted any
  </p>
  <p>
   great learning or notable accomplishments.

  </p>
  <p>
   which came with no responsibilities but yielded a modest annual income of 98.85
  </p>
  <p>
   scudi.39 This financial independence allowed Rossi to spend the remainder of his life
  </p>
  <p>
   focused on writing and publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
   As evidenced in his published letters, Rossi was an active participant in the Res
  </p>
  <p>
   publica litterarum (Republic of Letters), the pan-European intellectual community that
  </p>
  <p>
   fostered humanistic studies and the exchange of ideas via epistolary correspondence.
  </p>
  <p>
   He cultivated friendships with fellow humanists in such places as Italy, France,
  </p>
  <p>
   Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In his personal life, however, Rossi chose to
  </p>
  <p>
   remain alone, never marrying or having children. Gerboni points to one of his dialogues
  </p>
  <p>
   for a clue as to why, citing an interlocutor named Iucundus who, when asked why he
  </p>
  <p>
   never married, explains that the main two reasons were fear of losing his freedom to a
  </p>
  <p>
   carping wife, and fear that she would give birth to children who were bow-legged,
  </p>
  <p>
   knock-kneed, squinty-eyed, buck-toothed, and ill-behaved.40 Gerboni concedes that
  </p>
  <p>
   39 Gerboni 1899: 41-2; De Gregori 1942: 268. The Aqua Marrana was a medieval aqueduct that brought
  </p>
  <p>
   water from the Alban Hills to the Lateran section of town. Regarding his title, which he calls a “nudus
  </p>
  <p>
   honor,” Rossi writes this: “Ego autem ad meum officium quod attinet nunquam scivi quaenam esset haec
  </p>
  <p>
   aqua Marana, unde orietur, qua flueret, quid utilitatis ex ea Populus Romanus acciperet” (“Regarding my
  </p>
  <p>
   title, I have never known what the Aqua Marrana was, where it originated, where it flowed, and what use it
  </p>
  <p>
   was to the Roman people” Ep. ad Tyrr. 2.LXVII). Such purely honorary titles were a mechanism for raising
  </p>
  <p>
   money for the public coffers. Citizens could purchase fanciful titles like Commissario dell’Acqua Marrana,
  </p>
  <p>
   Guardiano della Meta Sudante, Revisore delle Mura della Città di Roma, Custode dei Trofei di Mario, and
  </p>
  <p>
   in return they would receive an annual payout much like a municipal bond coupon. This system continued
  </p>
  <p>
   until 1811, when it was abolished by imperial decree (De Gregori 1942: 268-9). Rossi stopped receiving
  </p>
  <p>
   payouts for his title around 1645, and in 1647 he protested by penning, in jest, an oration titled Pro
  </p>
  <p>
   pecunia mea addressed to the Senatus Populusque Romanus (S.P.Q.R.) and appealing to the Patres
  </p>
  <p>
   Conscripti (senators), making the case that he deserved this income because of the honor his
  </p>
  <p>
   publications, with their elegant Latin, brought to the city (this oration, the twenty-second in his work
  </p>
  <p>
   Orationes viginti duae, is a clear reference to Cicero’s Pro domo sua). Rossi fought to have his stipend
  </p>
  <p>
   reinstated on other fronts as well, including complaining to Fabio Chigi in a number of letters (e.g., Ep. ad
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyrr. 2.LI and 2.LIII) claiming that his impecunious state was preventing him from sending congratulations
  </p>
  <p>
   to Camillo Pamphili (nephew of Pope Innocent X) and Olimpia Aldobrandini on the occasion of their
  </p>
  <p>
   wedding (Ep. ad Tyrr. 2.LV). Some combination of his complaining and public pressure apparently
  </p>
  <p>
   succeeded, since he managed to obtain at least a partial reimbursement for the missed payments shortly
  </p>
  <p>
   before his death (Ep. ad Tyrr. 2.LXVII; Gerboni 1899: 42-4; De Gregori 1942: 272-3).

   40 Gerboni 1899: 29 citing Dial. XVII.5.
  </p>
  <p>
   21
  </p>
  <p>
   these assertions were made primarily for humorous and rhetorical effect, and he
  </p>
  <p>
   surmises that the real reason was probably that the majority of educated laymen
  </p>
  <p>
   aspiring to a career in the Roman Curia tended not to marry, surrounded as they were
  </p>
  <p>
   by clerics.41 On the other hand, Rossi also never entered the priesthood, which Gerboni
  </p>
  <p>
   ascribes to a similar fear of losing his liberty, and also to the fact that he ultimately did
  </p>
  <p>
   not feel a strong spiritual calling to such a life.42 Rossi died on November 13, 1647, at
  </p>
  <p>
   the age of seventy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intellectual and Artistic Milieu of Seventeenth-Century Rome
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s active literary life largely coincided with the period known as the Baroque.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though there is no consensus regarding the precise dates that demarcate this era,43 the
  </p>
  <p>
   Baroque period in Italy more or less coincides with the seventeenth century (seicento).44
  </p>
  <p>
   The Baroque aesthetic was characterized by meraviglia (wonder or marvel) and
  </p>
  <p>
   comprised elements intended to act on the emotions of the reader or viewer: the
  </p>
  <p>
   supernatural or fantastic (favoloso), a surprising and pleasing style achieved via clever
  </p>
  <p>
   metaphor and ornament (concetti or concettismo), and the application of wit (arguzia)
  </p>
  <p>
   that allows the reader or viewer to “[glimpse] the truth of things in a unique way.”45 As
  </p>
  <p>
   Peter Rietbergen explains, the Baroque aesthetic was all-encompassing; it was not just

  <p>
   43 Cherchi 1997: 301. Art historians generally define the period as spanning from the late sixteenth
  </p>
  <p>
   century (the end of Mannerism) to the late seventeenth century (the beginning of Rococo) (Battistini 2000:
  </p>
  <p>
   14-5; Galluzzi 2005: 16). Historians of literature have traditionally set the parameters of the Baroque
  </p>
  <p>
   period as beginning with the death of the poet Torquato Tasso in 1595 and ending with the foundation of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Accademia dell’Arcadia in 1690 (Maravall 1986: 3-4; Cherchi 1997: 301).

  </p>
  <p>
   an artistic style but “a style of living wherein all elements of life were fundamentally
  </p>
  <p>
   united” to create a sense of wonder.46 The author who is best known for representing
  </p>
  <p>
   the Baroque literary aesthetic of meraviglia is Giambattista Marino, though he had
  </p>
  <p>
   already passed away by the time the Baroque era reached its apex under Pope Urban
  </p>
  <p>
   VIII.47
  </p>
  <p>
   The Baroque aesthetic was a response to a critical historical moment for the
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman Catholic Church. During the post-Tridentine Catholic reform movement, or the
  </p>
  <p>
   Counter-Reformation, the Church sought to reassert its power and to reestablish Rome
  </p>
  <p>
   as the physical and spiritual center of the Catholic world.48 The consolidation and
  </p>
  <p>
   maintenance of temporal and spiritual power required the participation of the populace.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Baroque aesthetic—embodied in theater performances, music, public recitations,
  </p>
  <p>
   architecture, monuments, and highly visible displays of wealth—served to overwhelm
  </p>
  <p>
   and delight the reader or viewer, while at the same time leading him or her to embrace
  </p>
  <p>
   what the Roman Catholic Church deemed correct spiritual teaching (delectare et
  </p>
  <p>
   docere).49
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the central drivers of culture in Baroque Rome was the Jesuit order,
  </p>
  <p>
   whose Collegio Romano was the principal institution for secondary education. The
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesuit curriculum was based on principles of what Fumaroli terms “Christian humanism,”
  </p>
  <p>
   a fusion of the disciplined rules found in Cicero and Quintilian and the meditative and
  </p>

   47 Galluzzi 2005: 17.
  </p>
  <p>
   48 Rietbergen 2006: 13. Battistini (2000: 22) describes the Baroque period in Italy as the manifestation of
  </p>
  <p>
   a profound anthropological crisis that produced upheavals and imbalances resulting in the progressive
  </p>
  <p>
   shift of the political center of gravity from Italy and the Mediterranean to northern Europe.

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   contemplative approach to spirituality as found in the Exercitia spiritualia of Igantius of
  </p>
  <p>
   Loyola.50 Under the Jesuit-educated, humanist pope Urban VIII and his nephew,
  </p>
  <p>
   Cardinal Francesco Barberini, Rome experienced a cultural “renovatio” that Fumaroli
  </p>
  <p>
   describes as a second Roman Renaissance.51 During this period Rome became a
  </p>
  <p>
   beacon for intellectuals and artists from all over Europe, who flocked to Rome in order
  </p>
  <p>
   to be part of this flourishing activity in literature, art, and science. Many of them were
  </p>
  <p>
   members of the Academia degli Umoristi, which became an important arbiter of style
  </p>
  <p>
   (optimus stylus) during this period.52
  </p>
  <p>
   Baroque literature has often been judged negatively as extravagant, decadent,
  </p>
  <p>
   and representing, as one author described, “the nadir of Italian literature.”53 Scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   who resist this assessment do so from different vantages. IJsewijn, for example, argues
  </p>
  <p>
   that such a characterization tends to reflect only vernacular works, and that any
  </p>
  <p>
   adequate assessment of the literary output of seicento Rome must also take into
  </p>
  <p>
   consideration Latin works written during the period. In his view, “many of the flaws
  </p>
  <p>
   which critics usually find in the Italian writings of the age, such as bad taste and
  </p>
  <p>
   extravagance, are markedly absent from the best of their Latin counterparts.”54

  <p>
   52 Fumaroli 1978: 812-3.
  </p>
  <p>
   53 Cherchi 1997: 301; Galluzzi 2005: 22, 25. The negative assessment of the Baroque period began with
  </p>
  <p>
   literary critics in the Arcadian period of the late seventeenth century, continued through the eighteenth
  </p>
  <p>
   century Romantics, and was supported by the influential critics Francesco De Sanctis in the nineteenth
  </p>
  <p>
   century and Benedetto Croce in the twentieth century (Asor Rosa 1974: 3; Fumaroli 1978: 802).
  </p>
  <p>
   54 IJsewijn 1995: 82. IJsewijn’s assertion that the Baroque era embraces “bad taste and extravagance” is
  </p>
  <p>
   also incomplete and itself falls into the literary critical tradition that viewed vernacular Baroque literature in
  </p>
  <p>
   a negative light. Drawing a distinction between measured literature in Latin and extravagant literature in
  </p>
  <p>
   Italian risks doing a disservice to the complexity of both. A case in point is Giambattista Marino, who has
  </p>
  <p>
   been held up by literary critics as the epitome of the exaggerated Baroque style embodying “everything
  </p>
  <p>
   bad in the Baroque world” (Cherchi 1997: 301). Marino, however, actually shunned gratuitous virtuosity
  </p>
  <p>
   24
  </p>
  <p>
   Fumaroli, on the other hand, argues that the very distinction between Baroque and
  </p>
  <p>
   Classical aesthetic is exaggerated and unnecessary, and that both the rigorous
  </p>
  <p>
   standards of Ciceronianism and individual (even eccentric) Baroque style are
  </p>
  <p>
   manifestations of the limitless ways one can express one’s relationship with the
  </p>
  <p>
   immutable logos of the Catholic Church, which was forced to become more flexible and
  </p>
  <p>
   open to different means of expression after the Reformation.55
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi was certainly aware of these aesthetic debates. Classical authors provided
  </p>
  <p>
   him a touchstone that guided his style and often put him at odds with the more
  </p>
  <p>
   experimental trends embraced by his contemporaries. As Gerboni demonstrates, Rossi
  </p>
  <p>
   expressed a clear preference for Ciceronian Latin over the sort of style he described as
  </p>
  <p>
   “novum . . . atque sublime” (“new and sublime”),56 criticizing those who rejected the
  </p>
  <p>
   “verba pura atque dilucida, sententias apertas” (“pure, clear words and manifest
  </p>
  <p>
   meanings”) of Cicero, in favor of overwrought meraviglia, as privileging form over
  </p>
  <p>
   substance: “semper tumidi, semper inflati, alas pandunt, montium vertices appetunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   nubes et inania captunt” (“turgid and swollen, they spread their wings and reach for the
  </p>
  <p>
   mountaintops, only to grasp clouds and emptiness”).57
  </p>
  <p>
   and advocated moderation, distinguishing in his 1614 Dicerie sacre between “l’eccellente” and “il goffo”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“excellence” and “gaudiness”) in art (Galluzzi 2005: 41). Moreover, Marino was a member of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Accademia degli Umoristi and was even elected its Principe in 1623.
  </p>
  <p>
   55 Fumaroli 1978: 828-30.
  </p>
  <p>
   56 Ep. ad div. 1.IV.13, as quoted also in Gerboni 1899: 101-2. Among the other sources Gerboni cites
  </p>
  <p>
   where Rossi expresses his preference for ancient authors, especially Cicero, over what Gerboni (1899:
  </p>
  <p>
   102, n. 1-2) calls the “nuova scuola,” are: Ep. ad div. 1.V.10, 1.VII.1, 1.VII.3; Ep. ad div. 2.IX.7, 2.IX.8.
  </p>
  <p>
   57 Ep. ad div. 1.VII.1, addressed to Girolamo Aleandro the younger, as quoted in Gerboni 1899: 102.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi repurposes this letter as his dedicatory letter in Eudemia to Girolamo Aleandro.
  </p>
  <p>
   25
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not only with his letters that Rossi inveighs against this new style. Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   also serves as his vehicle for criticizing writers who turn their back on ancient authors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Book Three, for example, he includes poems on such subjects as a honey apple,
  </p>
  <p>
   Julius Caesar’s beard, and a pomegranate, and the narrator mentions someone who
  </p>
  <p>
   composed a laudatory poem to a gnat. These compositions and references serve to
  </p>
  <p>
   poke fun at the Baroque proliferation of paradoxical encomia, poems in praise of
  </p>
  <p>
   everyday objects.58 In addition, in Books Four and Nine, the two Romans meet people
  </p>
  <p>
   who, respectively, express indignation at being compared to ancient authors and insist
  </p>
  <p>
   on their own superiority. One of them declares: “sane pudeat me Virgilianis similes
  </p>
  <p>
   versus efficere” (“I would be embarrassed to compose verses that are anything like
  </p>
  <p>
   Virgil’s”); while the other one insists that the writings of ancient authors must be
  </p>
  <p>
   measured against his own: “scriptores veteres . . . ad sui judicium acuminis revocare ac
  </p>
  <p>
   de diuturna regni possessione . . . est conatus dejicere” (“he attempted to measure
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient authors . . . against the criterion of his own acumen and dislodge them from
  </p>
  <p>
   their long-standing supremacy”). Thus Rossi’s novel, aside from being a social critique,
  </p>
  <p>
   is also an artistic one—to the detriment of his own contemporaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reiterate Reitbergen’s assessment, the Baroque aesthetic was an all-
  </p>
  <p>
   encompassing lifestyle that included “banquets and behavior and books.”59 Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia parades this all-encompassing aesthetic before his readers’ eyes. Writing in
  </p>
  <p>
   Ciceronian Latin, he lays bare a society, fashioned and fostered by the powerful
  </p>
  <p>
   Barberini family and their circle, that cultivated literary and artistic showmanship,

   Gian Vittorio Rossi: Works
  </p>
  <p>
   Published Works
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s first publications date to the early 1600s: Orationes novem (Luigi Zanetti,
  </p>
  <p>
   1603); Oratio de Christi domini ascensu (Guglielmo Facciotti, 1604); and De diuturna
  </p>
  <p>
   aegrotatione toleranda oratio (Carlo Vullietti, 1605). Printed in Rome, and under his real
  </p>
  <p>
   name Ioannes Victorius Roscius, they were publications of orations he gave in various
  </p>
  <p>
   venues, including in meetings of the Accademia degli Umoristi.60 Rossi’s most active
  </p>
  <p>
   period of publishing did not begin until 1643—when Rossi was well into his sixties—and
  </p>
  <p>
   it came about thanks to his relationship with Fabio Chigi. By the early 1640s, Chigi had
  </p>
  <p>
   taken an active interest in Rossi61 and had connected him with Barthold Nihus, a
  </p>
  <p>
   German convert to Catholicism who was the editor for the Amsterdam-based printer
  </p>
  <p>
   Joan Blaeu.62 Rossi’s delight at finally finding a publishing house he was happy with is
  </p>
  <p>
   evident from a 1643 letter to Nihus: “Iucundum mihi est in primis, reperiri typographum,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui meorum librorum aliquid imprimendum, suscipere velit” (“I am especially glad to
  </p>
  <p>
   60 These orations would eventually be collected together, augmented by others, and published by Blaeu
  </p>
  <p>
   in 1649 under the title Orationes viginti duae.
  </p>
  <p>
   61 The letters in Rossi’s published correspondence with Chigi (Ep. ad Tyrr.) date from 1641 to 1647
  </p>
  <p>
   (Gerboni 1899: 36).
  </p>
  <p>
   62 Blaeu issued books on Catholic subjects or by Catholic authors with the imprint of Jost Kalkhoven in
  </p>
  <p>
   Cologne (and sometimes under the names Johann Kinckius and Cornelius ab Egmondt). Dutch printers
  </p>
  <p>
   did this either to protect their Calvinist identity or, more likely, to avoid “needlessly disturbing relations with
  </p>
  <p>
   foreign rulers” (Frijhoff and Spies 2004: 266), thus protecting the market for Catholic books in the south
  </p>
  <p>
   (Clemens 1992: 90).
  </p>
  <p>
   27
  </p>
  <p>
   have found a printer who wants take on the publication of some of my books”).63 This
  </p>
  <p>
   collaboration resulted in the publication of more than fifteen titles, from 1643 to 1649.64
  </p>
  <p>
   The work for which Rossi is perhaps best known is Pinacotheca imaginum
  </p>
  <p>
   illustrium, which Blaeu published in three volumes over five years.65 It is often cited for
  </p>
  <p>
   its lively biographies of around 160 figures, including cardinals, poets, theologians,
  </p>
  <p>
   scientists, philosophers, and artists, who lived between the second half of the sixteenth
  </p>
  <p>
   and the first half of the seventeenth century. In his chapter on Rossi’s Pinacotheca
  </p>
  <p>
   included in his survey of seventeenth-century Italian literature, Benedetto Croce writes
  </p>
  <p>
   that the work depicts characters that are “disordinati, squilibrati, pazzeschi” (“messy,
  </p>
  <p>
   unbalanced, and mad”), and in a manner that underscores their psychological
  </p>
  <p>
   quirkiness.66 New editions of Pinacotheca continued to be published into the eighteenth
  </p>
  <p>
   century, the final one in 1729. Other works that remained popular and continued to
  </p>
  <p>
   enjoy new editions into the first half of the eighteenth century were Epistolae ad
  </p>
  <p>
   diversos, Epistolae ad Tyrrhenum, Orationes viginti duae, Exempla virtutum et vitiorum,
  </p>
  <p>
   63 Ep. ad div. 1.VI.VIII.
  </p>
  <p>
   64 Rossi died in 1647 but he had a hand in the preparation of the works that Blaeu published after his
  </p>
  <p>
   death. Any works published after 1649, beginning with the 1676 imprint of Exempla virtutum et vitiorum,
  </p>
  <p>
   were new editions prepared using the existing editions as the exemplar but without the involvement of the
  </p>
  <p>
   original collaborators (Berthold Nihus died in 1657 and Fabio Chigi was elevated to the papacy in 1655).
  </p>
  <p>
   The continued interest in Rossi by German scholars and publishers is evidenced by the almost
  </p>
  <p>
   exclusively German editions of his works, with the addition of many notes and prefatory materials, that
  </p>
  <p>
   continued to be prepared and published through the late 1740s.
  </p>
  <p>
   65 Blaeu printed the first edition of the first volume in 1643 under the name Cornelius ab Egmond. A new
  </p>
  <p>
   edition of the first volume, as well as a second volume titled Pinacotheca altera, was printed by Blaeu
  </p>
  <p>
   under the name Jost Kalkhoven in 1645, and a third volume, Pinacotheca tertia, was printed in 1648, also
  </p>
  <p>
   under the name Jost Kalkhoven.
  </p>
  <p>
   66 Croce and Fabrizi 2003: 136. The prospect of having his quirks immortalized in the Pinacotheca so
  </p>
  <p>
   concerned the French scholar Jean-Jacques Bouchard that, as the first volume of Rossi’s collection of
  </p>
  <p>
   portraits was being prepared, he had Cassiano Dal Pozzo intervene on his behalf with Fabio Chigi to
  </p>
  <p>
   have his biography removed (Herklotz 2008).

  <p>
   Unpublished or Lost Works
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi wrote a number of works that are now lost. Among his sacred dramatic
  </p>
  <p>
   works was a play titled Tobia, which, according to Leone Allacci, was published in 1629
  </p>
  <p>
   in Viterbo.67 Rossi’s unpublished sacred plays include Esau et Iacob, Christi Domini
  </p>
  <p>
   praesepis, Filius profusus ac perditus, and Susanna. His play Magdalena flens ad
  </p>
  <p>
   sepulchrum Christi, set to music by the composer Virgilio Mazzocchi, was performed
  </p>
  <p>
   multiple times, including in a private performance before cardinals Francesco Barberini,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ippolito Aldobrandini, Roberto Ubaldini, and the Polish ambassador to Rome,68 but the
  </p>
  <p>
   text has not survived. Another musical performance consisted of a sacred play about
  </p>
  <p>
   Ignatius Loyola set to music by the castrato and composer Loreto Vittori.69 Other lost
  </p>
  <p>
   short works are Vita Iuvenalis Ancinae Saluciarum Episcopi, Vita Sancti Isidori, Vita
  </p>
  <p>
   B[eati] Stanislae Kostka, Canonis missae interpretatio, De officio ac dignitate
  </p>
  <p>
   sacerdotis, Totius missae sacrificii explicatio, and Confessiones propriae, modeled after
  </p>
  <p>
   St. Augustine’s Confessions.70
  </p>
  <p>
   67 Tobia is the only one of Rossi’s plays that is listed in Drammaturgia di Leone Allacci: divisa in sette
  </p>
  <p>
   indici (Roma: Per il Mascardi, 1666). The entry reads, “Tobia, ridotto in atti recitabili da Gio: Vittorio de
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi insieme con le rime sue spirituali, in Viterbo appresso Agostino Discepoli 1629 in 4.v.” (317-18).
  </p>
  <p>
   See also Gerboni 1899: 39; Giachino 2002: 186; Rossi’s entry in DBI. Both Gerboni and Giachino write
  </p>
  <p>
   that Tobia was published in 1623, which differs from the 1629 date provided by Allacci.
  </p>
  <p>
   68 Ep. ad. div. 1.IV.XVI; Gerboni 1899: 39; DBI. The Polish ambassador (“legatus Regis Poloniae”) was
  </p>
  <p>
   probably Jerzy Ossoliński.
  </p>
  <p>
   69Ep. ad div. 1.VI.XXXVII; Gerboni: 39-40; DBI. Loreto Vittori appears as a character in Book Ten of
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   70 For a list of lost works see Gerboni 1899: 74 and Giachino 2002: 186. These lost works are also listed
  </p>
  <p>
   under the entry for “Ioannes Victorius Roscius” in the second volume of Prospero Mandosio’s Bibliotheca
  </p>
  <p>
   romana (1682-92: 251-5). Mandosio (1643-1724) was a member of the Accademia degli Umoristi.

  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi began writing Eudemia in the 1620s after he had retreated to private life
  </p>
  <p>
   upon the death of Cardinal Peretti-Montalto.71 By 1631, as indicated in a letter to
  </p>
  <p>
   Giovanni Zaratino Castellini, Rossi was actively in search of someone to dedicate his
  </p>
  <p>
   book to: “[Satyram] ego possim epistola, quae tuas veras laudas contineat, eidem
  </p>
  <p>
   praefixa, tuo nomini inscriptam emittere, et quantum mihi ingenii vires ferunt, tibi decus
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi ipsi laudem acquirere” (“I could publish [my satire] with a dedicatory letter to you
  </p>
  <p>
   and, to the best of my ability, gain honor for you and praise for myself”).72 We know that
  </p>
  <p>
   Castellini declined this offer because Rossi wrote to him again three years later,
  </p>
  <p>
   informing him that the bookseller Giovanni Battista Tamantini, whom he refers to by the
  </p>
  <p>
   pseudonym Thaumantinus,73 was supposedly going to help him get his as-yet-still-
  </p>
  <p>
   71 Gerboni 1899: 107-8; Giachino 2002: 187.
  </p>
  <p>
   72 Ep. ad div. 1.III.XV.
  </p>
  <p>
   73 Giovanni Battista Tamantini was also known as Giovanni Battista Brugiotti. Gerboni (1899: 108, n. 3;
  </p>
  <p>
   130) identifies Thaumantinus (also called “Thaumantius” and “Thaumas” in Eudemia) as a certain
  </p>
  <p>
   “Hermannus” because Rossi mentions a bookseller by this name in his letters (e.g., Ep. ad div. 1.VII.XXVI
  </p>
  <p>
   and Ep. ad Tyrr. 1.XXIII). I have concluded that the pseudonym “Thaumantinus” is more likely a reference
  </p>
  <p>
   to Tamantini—given the similarity of his real name to the pseudonym—and that Rossi is referring in these
  </p>
  <p>
   instances to two different booksellers: “Thaumantinus” is Tamantini and “Hermannus” is the bookseller
  </p>
  <p>
   Hermann Scheus (I thank Daniel Stolzenberg of the University of California at Davis for the identification
  </p>
  <p>
   of the latter). My identification of “Thaumantinus” as Tamantini is bolstered by an account given by the
  </p>
  <p>
   Italian author Angelico Aprosio (1677: 196), as mentioned in Gryphius (1710: 491), indicating that Rossi
  </p>
  <p>
   and Tamantini were indeed acquainted: “Ma già che habbiamo fatto mentione dell’Eudemia, non sarebbe
  </p>
  <p>
   gran fatto che, prima di compiere questo libro, mi risolvessi di pubblicarne la chiave, che in parte
  </p>
  <p>
   dall’autore era stata communicata a Giovan Battista Tamantini che governava la libraria del Sole” (“As
  </p>
  <p>
   long as I have mentioned Eudemia, it would not be a great effort on my part, before finishing my book, to
  </p>
  <p>
   publish a key, which was partially communicated by the author to Giovanni Battista Tamantini, who ran
  </p>
  <p>
   the bookstore at the [sign of the] Sun”). As far as I can tell, the key was never published. Further
  </p>
  <p>
   corroboration that “Thaumantinus” and “Hermannus” are two different people (Tamantini and Scheus,
  </p>
  <p>
   respectively) is that they were collaborators in real life. In 1624, the bookseller Andrea Brugiotti, who had
  </p>
  <p>
   his shop in Piazza Pasquino at the sign of the Sun, entrusted the running of his bookstore to Hermann
  </p>
  <p>
   Scheus and to his nephew Giovanni Battista Tamantini (Franchi and Sartori 1994, vol. 1: 92-93, incl. 92,
  </p>
  <p>
   n. 7). In 1627 or 1628 Brugiotti sold his business to Tamantini, and Scheus opened his own shop in
  </p>
  <p>
   Piazza Pasquino at the sign of the Queen (“sub signo Reginae” or “all’insegna della Regina”) (Romani
  </p>
  <p>
   1973: 78; Borraccini Verducci et al. 2013: 193). Both Gerboni (1899: 130) and Giachino (2002: 197)
  </p>
  <p>
   maintain that the person behind the pseudonym “Thaumantinus” was Rossi’s editor in real life. While it is
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly possible that Scheus and/or Tamantini helped arrange for the 1637 publication of Rossi’s book
  </p>
  <p>
   30
  </p>
  <p>
   unpublished novel printed in Venice: “bibliopola illi in animo est Venetias imprimendam
  </p>
  <p>
   eam mittere (“the bookseller has in mind to send it to Venice for printing”).74 No
  </p>
  <p>
   Venetian edition ever materialized. Instead, looking back in a 1646 letter to Kaspar
  </p>
  <p>
   Schoppe, Rossi explained the circumstances by which Eudemiae libri VIII finally came
  </p>
  <p>
   to be published by the Elzevier press in Leiden:
  </p>
  <p>
   Venit die quodam ad me bibliopola, amicus meus, cum Argedine Io[annis]
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclaji, cuius ego libri inspiciendi eram oppidus. Ac ioci causa: “Habeo,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquam, ego quoque librum . . . huic non longe dissimilem.” Tum ille:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Cedo mihi eum, ait ut legam.” Confestim tradidi, eo animo ut numquam
  </p>
  <p>
   repeterem. At vis biennium intercesserat ab hoc sermone, cum illo habito,
  </p>
  <p>
   cum mihi libenter, quem in malam rem abisse credideram, Lugduni
  </p>
  <p>
   Batavorum impressus ostenditur.75
  </p>
  <p>
   One day my friend the bookseller76 came to me with John Barclay’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Argenis, which I was eager to take a look at. Jokingly, I said to him: “I also
  </p>
  <p>
   have a book that is not too different from this.” Then he said: “Give it to
  </p>
  <p>
   me, I want to read it.” I gave it to him straight away, thinking that I would
  </p>
  <p>
   never see it again. But hardly two years had passed from that meeting
  </p>
  <p>
   with him when he showed me the book—which I thought had met a bad
  </p>
  <p>
   end—having been published in Leiden.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemiae libri VIII was the first work published under his pseudonym, Ianus Nicius
  </p>
  <p>
   Erythraeus.77
  </p>
  <p>
   in Leiden, given their connection with northern European publishers, I cannot confirm that Rossi’s Rome-
  </p>
  <p>
   based bookseller acquaintances did any editing for him.
  </p>
  <p>
   74 Ep. ad div. 1.IV.XVI.
  </p>
  <p>
   75 Ep. ad div. 2.VIII.VI. The title page of Eudemiae libri VIII indicates no publisher, but we know that
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclay’s Argenis was published in 1630 in Leiden by Bonaventure and Abraham Elzevier. Moreover,
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemiae libri VIII is listed in the four Elzevier bibliographies: Rahir 1896: 456; Berghman 1911: 1314;
  </p>
  <p>
   Copinger 1927: 1643; Willems 1974: 456.
  </p>
  <p>
   76 We do not know if this is Giovanni Battista Tamantini, Hermann Scheus, or another bookseller.
  </p>
  <p>
   77 Rossi’s justification for using a pseudonym was to avoid scorn in the face of a negative reaction to his
  </p>
  <p>
   satire: “ad vitandam invidiam, alio [satyram] nomine inscripserim” (Ep. ad div. 1.III.XV). More than a
  </p>
  <p>
   decade later, after the publication of the 1645 edition, he told Kaspar Schoppe that he had wanted to
  </p>
  <p>
   conceal his identity because he was embarrassed by the book: “Cujus libri cum postea puderet . . . ne
  </p>
  <p>
   tale unquam opus ex me prodiisse constaret, optavi in eo, loco Io. Victorii Roscii, Iani Nicii Erythraei
  </p>
  <p>
   nomen inscripsi” (“Because I was subsequently embarrassed by it . . . I decided to ascribe it to Ianus
  </p>
  <p>
   31
  </p>
  <p>
   After its publication in Leiden, Eudemia libri VIII circulated in Northern Europe
  </p>
  <p>
   where it likely came to the attention of Fabio Chigi, who had been named Papal Nuncio
  </p>
  <p>
   to Cologne in 1639. Chigi already knew Rossi from the Academia degli Umoristi, which
  </p>
  <p>
   he began to frequent when he moved from Siena to Rome in 1626 to embark on his
  </p>
  <p>
   ecclesiastical career.78 An early biography of Chigi, also a neo-Latin poet, indicates that
  </p>
  <p>
   the bishop was always eager to read things that were new, unique, and interesting—
  </p>
  <p>
   and it probably did not hurt that Chigi himself appears in Book Three of Eudemia as a
  </p>
  <p>
   noble young man named Tyrrhenus attending a meeting of a literary academy.79 Chigi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   introduction of Rossi to Joan Blaeu and his editor Barthold Nihus resulted in the 1645
  </p>
  <p>
   publication of Eudemiae libri decem, the second, expanded edition of Eudemia.80 Title
  </p>
  <p>
   pages for both the 1637 and 1645 editions are found in Appendix B.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicius Erythraeus instead of Gian Vittorio Rossi, so it wouldn’t be obvious that I was the one who wrote it”
  </p>
  <p>
   Ep. ad div. 2.VIII.VI).
  </p>
  <p>
   78 Gerboni (1899: 36) maintains that Rossi first met Chigi in 1615 when the latter participated in some
  </p>
  <p>
   meetings of the Accademia degli Umoristi (Chigi would have been sixteen years old). I am more inclined
  </p>
  <p>
   to agree with Ingo Herklotz (2008: 147 and 2017: 161), who places their interaction between 1626 and
  </p>
  <p>
   1629 when Chigi moved to Rome and regularly attended academy meetings.
  </p>
  <p>
   79 Pallavicino 1839: 49 (Pallavicino makes a dating error here because Eudemia was published two years
  </p>
  <p>
   before Chigi became Papal Nuncio to Cologne). The pseudonym Tyrrhenus derives from Τυρρηνία
  </p>
  <p>
   (Tyrrhenia) the ancient Greek word for Etruria, a reference to Chigi’s Tuscan origins.
  </p>
  <p>
   80 In a 1643 letter to Chigi, Rossi mentions an expanded Belgian edition: “Accepi a quodam, qui se
  </p>
  <p>
   vidisse affirmat, fuisse Romam missa tria Eudemiae exempla denuo cum auctario duorum librorum, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   desiderabantur, in Belgio impressae” (“I heard from someone, who confirmed he had seen it, that three
  </p>
  <p>
   copies of Eudemia had been printed in Belgium, which finally included the two additional missing books”
  </p>
  <p>
   (Ep. ad Tyrr. XXXIII; see also Gerboni [1899: 115] and Incisa della Rochetta [1949: 220]). Neither
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerboni nor Incisa della Rochetta question the existence of a 1642 edition in ten books. In a 1642 letter to
  </p>
  <p>
   Chigi, Barthold Nihus mentions that Abraham Elzevier did indeed tell him that he had a manuscript of the
  </p>
  <p>
   augmented edition—“ab eodem [auctore Erythraeo] ad se pervenisse Eudemiam auctiorem quam fuit
  </p>
  <p>
   ante”; “[Elzevier] had received from that same [author Erythraeus] a version of Eudemia that was longer
  </p>
  <p>
   than it was before”]—but it does not seem that it was ever printed. In fact, through January 1644 Nihus
  </p>
  <p>
   continued reporting to Chigi that Elzevier was intending to print the second edition of Eudemia but never
  </p>
  <p>
   seems to have got around to it (e.g., “Eudemia necdum coepta excudi”; “the printing of Eudemia has not
  </p>
  <p>
   yet begun”). I am convinced that no such printed Elzevier edition exists because none besides the 1637
  </p>
  <p>
   editio princeps is listed in the various bibliographies of Elzevier imprints (Berghman; Copinger; Rahir;
  </p>
  <p>
   Willems). By September 1644 Nihus had started working on Eudemiae libri decem for Blaeu. For the
  </p>
  <p>
   32
  </p>
  <p>
   The only edition of Eudemia to be issued in print after Blaeu’s is Johann Christian
  </p>
  <p>
   Fischer’s 1740 Eudemiae libri decem, editio novissima, which includes a preface that
  </p>
  <p>
   reconstructs the work’s publication history based on Rossi’s letters. In 1998 the
  </p>
  <p>
   University of Kentucky’s Department of Modern and Classical Languages, Literatures
  </p>
  <p>
   and Cultures published an online version of Eudemia libri decem in its archive of neo-
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin texts, Retiarius: Commentarii Periodici Latini.
  </p>
  <p>
   The University of Kentucky’s online version includes notes by Jozef IJsewijn and
  </p>
  <p>
   a preface by Terence Tunberg. Tunberg’s preface, which includes the caveat that a true
  </p>
  <p>
   critical edition of this work is still needed, was the catalyst for this dissertation.81 In
  </p>
  <p>
   addition to providing extensive notes, I have translated the text into English. To my
  </p>
  <p>
   knowledge, this is the first and only translation into any language, not only of Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   but of any of Rossi’s works.82 The notes to the Latin text provide grammar and
  </p>
  <p>
   vocabulary assistance and indicate where Rossi is quoting from ancient authors. The
  </p>
  <p>
   notes to the English text explain Classical and contemporary cultural and historical

   terentius-tunberg. For the transcribed text I availed myself of the University of Kentucky’s online version
  </p>
  <p>
   because, thanks to the efforts of Lina IJsewijn-Jacobs, it was readily available in digital form. The
  </p>
  <p>
   University of Kentucky’s version is based on the 1645 edition in ten books, so I have collated the 1637
  </p>
  <p>
   and 1645 editions and noted any discrepancies. I reference IJsewijn’s notes, where appropriate, and
  </p>
  <p>
   point out any disagreement. I also removed the section and paragraph numbers that were added to the
  </p>
  <p>
   University of Kentucky’s text.

   82 While this dissertation focuses on the 1637 edition in eight books, as of this writing I have finished

   Literary Models for Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   Ancient Models
  </p>
  <p>
   In a letter to Carlo Mazzei,84 written a year after the publication of the second
  </p>
  <p>
   edition of Eudemia in ten books, Rossi addressed his correspondent’s apparently
  </p>
  <p>
   negative reaction to his work:
  </p>
  <p>
   Non dubito quin superioribus diebus nonnihil in mea Eudemia sis offensus
  </p>
  <p>
   quod, in referendis nonnullorum vitiis non semel modestiae fines
  </p>
  <p>
   praeterierim. Sed fac tibi veniat in mentem Horatii, Iuvenalis, aliorumque
  </p>
  <p>
   qui summa cum liberatate tum verborum tum sententiarum in hoc eodem
  </p>
  <p>
   argumenti genere sunt versati; ac praesertim tibi subjice Petronium
  </p>
  <p>
   Arbitrum quem ego imitando sum conatus effingere. Hic enim, ut videre
  </p>
  <p>
   potuisti, multo, ut de Lucilio Horatius inquit, aceto et sale urbem perfricuit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Denique memineris satyram eam esse quam in tot corruptis ac perditis
  </p>
  <p>
   hominum moribus non scribere difficillimum puto.85
  </p>
  <p>
   Doubtless some aspects of my Eudemia have recently caused you
  </p>
  <p>
   offense because, in recounting the vices of several people, I have more
  </p>
  <p>
   than once exceeded the bounds of moderation. But keep in mind the
  </p>
  <p>
   works of Horace, Juvenal, and others, who did the very same thing with
  </p>
  <p>
   the utmost freedom of speech and sentiment. Consider in particular
  </p>
  <p>
   Petronius Arbiter, whom I have attempted to imitate. As you can see, he
  </p>
  <p>
   rubbed the city with much salt and vinegar, just as Horace says about
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucilius. Finally, do not forget that my work is a satire, which I consider
  </p>
  <p>
   83 I rely primarily on six sources to identify, to the extent possible, the real names behind the
  </p>
  <p>
   pseudonyms. Two published keys are Gryphius 1710: 490-5 and Drujon 1966: 1052-7. Other sources are
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerboni 1899: 131-3; and Giachino 2002: 195-9. IJsewijn also identifies a number of names in his notes
  </p>
  <p>
   to Eud. 1998. In addition, I consulted two unpublished manuscript keys, one titled “Clavis et index in
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemiam” (Houghton Library, Harvard University) and one titled “Chiave dell’Eudemia del Signor Gio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vittorio De Rossi” that is sewn into a British Library copy of Eudemiae libri decem. I include the first leaf of
  </p>
  <p>
   each of these manuscripts keys in Appendix A.
  </p>
  <p>
   84 Carlo Mazzei published under the name Carolus a S. Antonio Patavino, which concords with Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   full salutation at the beginning of this letter: “Carolo Mazzaeo sive a S. Antonio Patavino, anconitano,
  </p>
  <p>
   scholarum piarum sacerdoti.” In his book about writers from Ascoli Piceno, Vecchietti (1790-96: 187) lists
  </p>
  <p>
   Carolus Mazzaeus under the heading “Antonio di Padova (P. Carlo di Sant’)” and shortly thereafter refers
  </p>
  <p>
   to him as “Carlo di S. Antonio di Padova” noting that he was from the “nobil famiglia Mazzei” of Ancona.

  </p>
  <p>
   34
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely difficult not to write in the face of mankind’s corrupt and
  </p>
  <p>
   irredeemable morals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Implied in this passage is that, because of its criticism of contemporary mores, Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   was not universally well received.
  </p>
  <p>
   In his own defense, Rossi inserts himself into a long and venerable line of
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient Roman satirists, whose legendary libertas (freedom of speech), he argues,
  </p>
  <p>
   enabled them to criticize their own societies. Rossi names Petronius Arbiter as his most
  </p>
  <p>
   immediate model, whose Satyricon, with its episodic tale and mix of prose and verse, is
  </p>
  <p>
   the closest ancient work to Eudemia in terms of genre. As additional models he cites the
  </p>
  <p>
   verse satirists Horace, Juvenal, and Lucilius, and he closes this passage with a phrase
  </p>
  <p>
   inspired by a line in Juvenal’s first satire, “difficile est saturam non scribere” (“it is
  </p>
  <p>
   difficult not to write satire”).86
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi invokes these ancient satirists as cover for any offense he may have
  </p>
  <p>
   caused. So what if he went a little too far in poking fun of his contemporaries (“non
  </p>
  <p>
   semel modestiae fines praeterierim”)—is that really any different from what the greatest
  </p>
  <p>
   satiric poets from Rome’s illustrious past had done? Rossi’s explanation of his satiric
  </p>
  <p>
   pedigree, however, merits examination. First of all, Rossi is inserting himself into two
  </p>
  <p>
   separate satiric traditions: prosimetric Menippean satire in the Petronian vein87 and the
  </p>
  <p>
   86 Juv. 1.30.
  </p>
  <p>
   87 The genre itself is named for Menippus of Garda, who was supposed to have invented the style for his
  </p>
  <p>
   serio-comic writings (Costa 2005: x). Menippus is less known by his own writings than as the character
  </p>
  <p>
   Menippus in the satires of Lucian of Samosata, whose comic dialogues and colloquial speech “supplied
  </p>
  <p>
   an important lacuna in classical literature by providing [early modern authors] a model of prose satire”
  </p>
  <p>
   (Marsh 1998: 10). Besides Lucian, Menippean satire was received into neo-Latin literature principally via
  </p>
  <p>
   Varro, Seneca, Apuleius, and Petronius (Tilg 2017: 323, referencing De Smet 1996: 60-8). De Smet
  </p>
  <p>
   (1996: 70) offers a useful working definition of humanist Menippean satire: “fictional (mostly first-person)
  </p>
  <p>
   narratives in prose interspersed with verse (which can, but need not be original), aimed at mockery and
  </p>
  <p>
   ridicule and often moralizing.” Tilg (2017: 323) explains that early modern authors composed their satires
  </p>
  <p>
   along two strains of Menippean satire, “Varronian” and “Petronian,” the former being “static, non-
  </p>
  <p>
   35
  </p>
  <p>
   verse satire of Lucilius, Horace, and Juvenal. Second, and more important, he is pinning
  </p>
  <p>
   his defense on the question of libertas, which, out of all of the ancient predecessors he
  </p>
  <p>
   mentions, was only enjoyed by Lucilius.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucilius’s poetry, which survived only in fragmentary form, is known primarily
  </p>
  <p>
   through Horace’s two books of satires, but also through the satires of Persius and
  </p>
  <p>
   Juvenal. A citizen of Republican Rome, member of the equestrian class, and friend of
  </p>
  <p>
   Scipio Aemilianus, Lucilius famously “gave free rein to his pugnacious temperament,
  </p>
  <p>
   attacking Scipio’s political enemies, his own literary opponents, and anyone he
  </p>
  <p>
   happened to dislike.”88 In the satires of Horace, Persius, and Juvenal—reflecting a
  </p>
  <p>
   period of time spanning the late Republic and early Empire—Lucilius served as a model
  </p>
  <p>
   of freedom of speech that could only be aspired to by later authors, but that could not be
  </p>
  <p>
   emulated on account of the changed political situation.89
  </p>
  <p>
   As Niall Rudd explains regarding Horace, “In 39 B.C. as a pardoned Republican
  </p>
  <p>
   and a man of no social consequence he could not afford to give indiscriminate
  </p>
  <p>
   offense.”90 Persius and Juvenal, who were writing, respectively, under the emperors
  </p>
  <p>
   Nero and Domitian (at least for Juvenal’s early satires), were constrained by a similar
  </p>
  <p>
   lack of libertas that found a creative outlet in satire. Additionally, although libertas is not
  </p>
  <p>
   an overt theme in the Satyricon, the novelistic genre—the fantastical voyage in the
  </p>
  <p>
   comic tradition—enabled Petronius to comment, albeit obliquely, on his own society
  </p>
  <p>
   narrative, and focused on a single event” like Seneca’s Apocolocyntosis and the latter being “dynamic,
  </p>
  <p>
   narrative, and episodic” in the style of Petronius Arbiter’s Satyricon.

  </p>
  <p>
   (ultimately provoking Nero’s ire and ending in his forced suicide).91 More than 1,500
  </p>
  <p>
   years separated Rossi from his ancient models, of course, yet he nevertheless
  </p>
  <p>
   composed his pungent satire in similarly restrictive circumstances. Living in Rome under
  </p>
  <p>
   the absolutist rule of Pope Urban VIII, and within the constraints of the Counter-
  </p>
  <p>
   Reformation, finding one’s works on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of
  </p>
  <p>
   Prohibited Books) was a real possibility, and running afoul of orthodox views was a risky
  </p>
  <p>
   proposition.92
  </p>
  <p>
   A useful lens through which to view Rossi’s insertion of his work into the two
  </p>
  <p>
   satiric traditions, as well as his invocation of libertas, is what Howard Weinbrot terms the
  </p>
  <p>
   “harsh” and “soft” modes of satire.93 Menippean satire is generally characterized as
  </p>
  <p>
   falling within the harsh mode, that is to say, it is an attack on societal vice via the
  </p>
  <p>
   slanderous mocking of people and customs. The verse satire of Lucilius, famous for its
  </p>
  <p>
   “censorious ridicule,”94 is also an example of this harsh mode. Horace, on the other
  </p>
  <p>
   hand—the verse satirist Rossi cites most frequently throughout his body of work—
  </p>
  <p>
   91 Rudich 1993: 155-6. For modern scholars, the identification of the author of the Satyricon with Nero’s
  </p>
  <p>
   “arbiter of elegance” Petronius is not a completely settled matter (OCD), but early modern authors did
  </p>
  <p>
   make this association. The Satyricon became a model for early modern romans à clef precisely for this
  </p>
  <p>
   reason, because humanist authors believed that Petronius was ridiculing the “depravities of Nero’s court
  </p>
  <p>
   under fictional names” (De Smet 1996: 85; see also Grafton 1990: 242). In his 1694 edition of Satyricon,
  </p>
  <p>
   François Nodot published a key revealing the supposed identities of the various characters (Barclay and
  </p>
  <p>
   Fleming 1973: xxi; see also Grafton 1990: 245). Though the frequent banquets and the presence of
  </p>
  <p>
   charlatans in Eudemia are reminiscent of the Cena Trimalchionis (Trimalchio's Dinner), the most famous
  </p>
  <p>
   passage in Petronius’s novel, that portion of the Satyricon was not rediscovered until 1650 (and not
  </p>
  <p>
   published until 1664), so it would not have been a model for Rossi (De Smet 1996: 103-4).
  </p>
  <p>
   92 Galileo Galilei, for example, was a contemporary of Rossi and frequented the same intellectual circles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Galileo appears as a character in Book Ten of Eudemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   93 Weinbrot 2005: 17-8. This “harsh mode” is a product of what Weinbrot calls “Bion’s, Menippus’s, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucian’s Greek outrage” (23), a reference to the satirists Bion of Borysthenes, Menippus of Garda, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucian of Samosata.
  </p>
  <p>
   94 Rudd 1982: 92.
  </p>
  <p>
   37
  </p>
  <p>
   presented a soft mode of satire that eschewed personal attacks and offered a moral
  </p>
  <p>
   corrective by praising virtue.95 In his letter to Mazzei, Rossi implies that, with Eudemia,
  </p>
  <p>
   he wants to have it both ways. On the one hand, he claims to be part of a long line of
  </p>
  <p>
   free-speakers stretching all the way back to Lucilius, choosing as his most overt model
  </p>
  <p>
   the harsh genre of Menippean satire; on the other hand, he exhorts his readers to view
  </p>
  <p>
   him as a soft-spoken, latter-day Horace, who, meaning no harm, is just trying to point
  </p>
  <p>
   out society’s flaws in a humorous way in order to expunge or correct them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s soft, Horatian stance, which becomes fully expressed in his 1646 letter to
  </p>
  <p>
   Mazzei, was not always in evidence. In fact, a close reading of Rossi’s correspondence
  </p>
  <p>
   over the entire publication process of Eudemia reveals that Rossi’s satiric persona
  </p>
  <p>
   underwent a consciously constructed transformation from harsh to soft as a strategy of
  </p>
  <p>
   self-defense in response to the reaction his satire generated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In two separate letters to Giovanni Zaratino Castellini, written in the early 1630s,
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi describes Eudemia as follows: “Hac in satyra, seu, si malis, historia (ita ego eam
  </p>
  <p>
   appello)” (“this satire, or, if you will, this history, which is what I call it”)96; and “satyram
  </p>
  <p>
   meam, vel historiam potius . . . nam quamvis quae in ea narrantur mendaciunculis
  </p>
  <p>
   asperserim, vera sunt ac me vivo contigerunt”97 (“my satire—or rather my history . . . for
  </p>
  <p>
   although I sprinkled my stories with made-up elements, they are true and they
  </p>
  <p>
   happened to me in real life”). Rossi’s conflation of history and satire underscores what
  </p>
  <p>
   Griffin describes as the two genres’ shared referential nature and rhetorical purpose:
  </p>
  <p>
   95 Weinbrot 2005: 18, 24.
  </p>
  <p>
   96 Ep. ad div. 1.III.XV.
  </p>
  <p>
   97 Ep. ad div. 1.IV.XVI.
  </p>
  <p>
   38
  </p>
  <p>
   “Like the satirist, the historian distinguishes between the virtuous and the wicked, and
  </p>
  <p>
   perpetuates the memory of both.”98
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s insistence on the truth of his satire also calls to mind another literary
  </p>
  <p>
   model for Eudemia in the harsh mode, which he does not overtly acknowledge: Lucian’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Ἀληθῆ διηγήματα (Vera historia, or A True Story), in which a first-person narrator
  </p>
  <p>
   recounts the “true story” of his fantastical voyage to fictional lands.99 Unlike Lucian’s
  </p>
  <p>
   narrator, who destabilizes his narrative from the outset by declaring that he is a liar who
  </p>
  <p>
   is “writing about things which I have neither seen nor had to do with nor heard from
  </p>
  <p>
   others,”100 Rossi puts himself forward as a truth teller whose “historia,” he insists, is
  </p>
  <p>
   based on things that actually happened. While he might be saying this for rhetorical
  </p>
  <p>
   effect, demonstrating his familiarity with Lucian’s tale, his claim to truth telling is
  </p>
  <p>
   nevertheless borne out by the fact that, unlike Lucian’s fantasy landscapes—peopled
  </p>
  <p>
   with strange creatures and characters from ancient history and mythology—Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia presents characters who can, for the most part, be traced to Rossi’s circle of
  </p>
  <p>
   friends.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the same letters to Castellini, referenced above, Rossi tells his friend that he
  </p>
  <p>
   was encouraged to publish his satire (“omnes uno ore mihi fuere auctores ut typis
  </p>
  <p>
   mandarem”; “everyone prompted me unanimously to publish it”) and that the censors
  </p>
  <p>
   98 Griffin (1994: 124) is referring to the ancient “exemplary” theory of history, which the Renaissance
  </p>
  <p>
   inherited.
  </p>
  <p>
   99 Lucian was an immensely popular author in the early modern period. David Marsh (1998: 2-6) explains
  </p>
  <p>
   that he was appreciated as a master of rhetoric, a moral philosopher, an iconoclast, and a “provocative
  </p>
  <p>
   satirist”: “One of Lucian’s most cherished literary ideals is that of parrhēsia, or outspokenness—a trait that
  </p>
  <p>
   links Lucian with two of the most outspoken humanists of the Renaissance, Lorenzo Valla and Desiderius
  </p>
  <p>
   Erasmus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   100 Lucian and Harmon 1953: 253.
  </p>
  <p>
   39
  </p>
  <p>
   did not oppose its publication (“censores delectati dicuntur et argumento et stylo, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   indignam eam judicarunt, quae typis mandetur”; “the censors were said to have enjoyed
  </p>
  <p>
   both the subject and the style, and did not deem it unworthy of publication”). But
  </p>
  <p>
   communications immediately following Eudemia’s 1637 publication indicate that its
  </p>
  <p>
   reception was not entirely positive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Particularly relevant are two letters, both from the year 1638, to Cardinal
  </p>
  <p>
   Francesco Barberini (dated March 31) and to Clemente Merlino, judge of the Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   Rota (dated October 25).101 The common theme of these letters is Rossi’s desire to
  </p>
  <p>
   mitigate any offense caused by his satire. In both of them he attempts to distance
  </p>
  <p>
   himself from his work, while at the same time standing by his use of humor to expose
  </p>
  <p>
   and expunge immoral behavior. The seeds of the rhetorical defense that Rossi would
  </p>
  <p>
   put forth eight years later, in his letter to Mazzei, are found in these early justifications.
  </p>
  <p>
   After an initial—and implausible—denial that he was the author of Eudemia,102
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s letter to Cardinal Barberini addresses complaints he heard about his satire
  </p>
  <p>
   being “perniciosum, corruptorem morum, famae aulicorum ac dignitatis eversorem”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“pernicious, corrupting of morals, and damaging to the dignity and reputation of those
  </p>
  <p>
   associated with the [papal] court”). Rossi stresses that Eudemia is a work of fiction, that
  </p>
  <p>
   it does not refer to any real people, and that only a person of ill will would associate the
  </p>
  <p>
   morally questionable characters in his satire with anyone in real life. Most importantly,
  </p>
  <p>
   101 Barberini (Ep. ad div. 1.VI.III); Merlino (Ep. ad div. 2.VI.V); see also Gerboni 111-3.
  </p>
  <p>
   102 “Cepi dolorem, quantum maximum animo capere possum, cum est ad me perlatum, esse aliquos, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   tibi pro certo affirmare audeant, meo ex ingenio librum illum prodiisse, qui nunc recens emanavit in
  </p>
  <p>
   vulgus, cui titulus est Eudemia, neque alio argumento ducuntur, nisi quod is, Ianum Nicium Erythraeum
  </p>
  <p>
   esse auctorem, venditet” (“I was pained more than my soul could bear when I received word that there
  </p>
  <p>
   were people who had the nerve to tell you that I was the author of that recently published book titled
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia, and they provide no other proof than that the author is named Ianus Nicius Erythraeus”).
  </p>
  <p>
   40
  </p>
  <p>
   he makes the case that he is not narrating acts of immorality in a witty and elegant
  </p>
  <p>
   manner in order to praise such acts, but to make fun of them, or rather, to hiss at them
  </p>
  <p>
   and drive them away (“non ad eum finem ut laudetur, set ut rideatur, vel potius, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam odio, vituperatione, atque etiam supplicio dignum exsibiletur explodeturque”).
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi is not yet explicitly referencing Horace’s corrective laughter, but this is certainly
  </p>
  <p>
   implied.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s letter to Clemente Merlino is longer and more substantial. Presenting as
  </p>
  <p>
   a sort of apologia for Eudemia, it puts forth a detailed rationale for his satire (“totam libri
  </p>
  <p>
   mei rationem”).103 His letter builds to a defense from an initial posture of distancing and
  </p>
  <p>
   minimizing, in which he claims that the satire was not his idea; his friends made him
  </p>
  <p>
   write it; it was meant to be seen only by a few people; and it merely consists of
  </p>
  <p>
   “ridiculae fabellae” (“ridiculous little stories”). For the first time, Rossi also introduces the
  </p>
  <p>
   notion, which he would go on to repeat on other occasions, that two books were left out
  </p>
  <p>
   of the 1637 edition, implying that these “missing” books would have clarified his intent or
  </p>
  <p>
   softened people’s reaction to it.104 By the end of the letter, Rossi embraces a full-
  </p>
  <p>
   throated defense of his use of satire to expunge immorality from society:
  </p>
  <p>
   103 IJsewijn (1999: 140) is of the opinion that, unlike John Barclay’s response to the reception of his
  </p>
  <p>
   Euphormionis Satyricon, Rossi “never had to write an apology, as did Barclay. As far as we know, a few
  </p>
  <p>
   friendly letters cleared the air.” While it is true that Rossi never published a formal apologia, his letter to
  </p>
  <p>
   Clemente, which argues thoroughly in his own defense, reads as such.
  </p>
  <p>
   104 “Etenim, ex decem libris, quibus universum illud opus constabat, octo tantum in vulgus emisit”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“Besides, of the ten books that made up the whole work, only eight were published”). I agree with
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerboni’s (1899: 115) assessment that it is unlikely there were two additional books accidentally left out
  </p>
  <p>
   of the 1637 printing, because many of the additions and corrections in the 1645 edition were precipitated
  </p>
  <p>
   by readers’ reactions to Eudemia. Interestingly, a bookseller named Thaumas, an interlocutor in the first
  </p>
  <p>
   dialogue of Dialog. XVII, informs a character named Erythraeus that his two lost books had been found
  </p>
  <p>
   and were going to be published: “libros illos duos ab impressore amissos esse inventos et propediem
  </p>
  <p>
   edendos” (“those two book have been found, which had been lost by the printer, and will be published
  </p>
  <p>
   soon”).
  </p>
  <p>

   Quaenam autem aptior, quae utilior, quae suavior, quaeque efficacius in

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   eorum numero erunt, quos, turpia isthaec flagitia sectari magis, quam
  </p>
  <p>
   fugere facta delectet. Sint illa quidem, ut dicitis, impura, exsecrabilia, sint
  </p>
  <p>
   suppliciis omnibus digna; at quaedam in illis festivitas inest, quae ad
  </p>
  <p>
   excitandum utiliter risum, et ad improborum insidias et machinationes

  <p>
   detegendas eludendasque, in primis valeant.
  </p>
  <p>
   What more suitable, useful, and agreeable means of censure can be
  </p>
  <p>
   found, that can effectively insinuate itself into the minds of men, than that
  </p>
  <p>
   which exposes—with real names concealed, times and locations changed,
  </p>
  <p>
   and with fictional characters—the sinful dispositions of the mind, as if
  </p>
  <p>
   through fun and joking? Ancient writings testify to the fact that this was
  </p>
  <p>
   always lawful and permitted according to both Greek and Roman custom.
  </p>
  <p>
   Was it not Horace who said: “Who is to prevent someone from telling the
  </p>
  <p>
   truth, as long as he is laughing.” “But,” they insist, “you set forth and
  </p>
  <p>
   display in your discourse the vile passions of certain private individuals,
  </p>
  <p>
   passions that are filthy even to think about let alone recount, as if painting
  </p>
  <p>
   them with a brush.” Those people are perhaps among those whom it
  </p>
  <p>
   pleases to pursue these base and shameful acts, rather than avoid them.
  </p>
  <p>
   So what if my writing is, as you say, foul, execrable, and worthy of every
  </p>
  <p>
   punishment; it nevertheless contains a certain hilarity that has the power,
  </p>
  <p>
   first and foremost, to spur useful laughter and to expose and mock the
  </p>
  <p>
   schemes and tricks of shameless men.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most central to Rossi’s defense of his work in this letter to Merlino is the notion of
  </p>
  <p>
   “useful laughter,” which is an inherent part of the soft Horatian satiric mode. Horace’s
  </p>
  <p>
   embrace of wit and humor as a corrective to societal ills is clearly expressed, for
  </p>
  <p>
   example, in Sat. I.X.14-5: “ridiculum acri / fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat
  </p>
  <p>
   res” (“great issues are usually resolved more forcefully and more effectively by wit than
  </p>
  <p>
   by castigation”).105 This spirit, fortified by Rossi’s almost direct quotation of Horace’s
  </p>
  <p>
   105 Translation from Rudd 1982: 93.
  </p>
  <p>
   42
  </p>
  <p>
   Sat. I.I.24-5, is congruent with Rossi’s desire to be seen not as a harsh mocker like
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucilius, Petronius, and Lucian, but as a gentle humorist like Horace, who desires to
  </p>
  <p>
   guide people to correct behavior through laughter.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contemporary Models
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite Rossi’s stated indebtedness to Petronius’s Satyricon,106 a more direct
  </p>
  <p>
   model for Eudemia was John Barclay’s Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon, published in
  </p>
  <p>
   two parts (in 1605 and 1607 respectively).107 The most significant neo-Latin Menippean
  </p>
  <p>
   satire of Rossi’s time, Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon, tells the story of Euphormio, a
  </p>
  <p>
   traveler from the idyllic fictional land of Lusinia, who is shocked by the corruption he
  </p>
  <p>
   finds in the land where he has arrived: seventeenth-century Europe. Part One of
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclay’s satire consists of the first-person narration of the title character Euphormio’s
  </p>
  <p>
   travels throughout Europe where, as David Fleming summarizes, he
  </p>
  <p>
   encounters many of the social and professional classes of the early
  </p>
  <p>
   seventeenth century . . . [and] discovers through bitter experience the
  </p>
  <p>
   defects of all those whom he meets: the jealously and internal rivalry of
  </p>
  <p>
   the clergy, the hypocrisy of physicians, the inconstancy of friends and
  </p>
  <p>
   lovers, the ostentation and selfishness of the nobility, the stupidity of
  </p>
  <p>
   rustics, the degeneracy of the learned.108
  </p>
  <p>
   Fleming describes Part One of Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon as “purely episodic”
  </p>
  <p>
   with short and self-contained incidents, ending without much advancement in plot or
  </p>
  <p>
   character development, and with Euphormio having “achieved nothing but
  </p>
  <p>
   106 Before Barclay, humanist authors did not tend to imitate the Satyricon directly. There were various
  </p>
  <p>
   reasons for this, one of which is that it was available to them only in a very fragmentary form (De Smet
  </p>
  <p>
   1996: 241), and another is because the erotic nature of the work made readers and would-be imitators
  </p>
  <p>
   cautious about declaring open adherence to Petronius (Barclay and Fleming 1973: xxiv).
  </p>
  <p>
   107 De Smet 1996: 32-3. The first early modern Menippean satire was Justus Lipsius’s 1581 Satyra
  </p>
  <p>
   Menippaea somnium (ibid.: 33). For Barclay’s Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon and Argenis as
  </p>
  <p>
   inspirations for Eudemia see also Giachino 2002: 190.

  <p>
   108 Barclay and Fleming 1973: xvii.
  </p>
  <p>
   43
  </p>
  <p>
   disillusionment and bitterness.”109 Part Two coheres much more as a narrative,
  </p>
  <p>
   consisting of “a few large sections, each of them embracing a considerable number of
  </p>
  <p>
   interrelated incidents” that all move the plot toward a singular goal: Euphormio’s
  </p>
  <p>
   reception and establishment in the court of King Tessaranactus (James I) in the court of
  </p>
  <p>
   Scolimorrhodia (England).110 Eudemia’s first-person narrative in the voice of Flavius
  </p>
  <p>
   Vopiscus Niger; the nonerotic nature of his main characters; his criticism of thieves,
  </p>
  <p>
   moneylenders, priests, quack doctors, and charlatans; and the disjointed, inconclusive
  </p>
  <p>
   nature of the narrative, is reminiscent of Barclay’s satire, particularly Part One.
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclay’s Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon was immensely popular, appearing in
  </p>
  <p>
   almost fifty editions, including multiple translations published over the course of a
  </p>
  <p>
   century.111 It was an important milestone in European literature not only because, as
  </p>
  <p>
   Fleming writes, “with the single exception of Don Quixote . . . [it] was the most important
  </p>
  <p>
   work of prose fiction published in Europe in the first decade of the seventeenth-
  </p>
  <p>
   century,”112 but also because it was the first major roman à clef (novels in which real
  </p>
  <p>
   people and events are disguised behind fictional names), a genre that remained very
  </p>
  <p>
   popular for the remainder of the century.113 Satire’s referential nature, pointing to people
  </p>
  <p>
   and events outside itself, provided fertile ground for the development of such novels. In
  </p>
  <p>
   the words of Dustin Griffin, “Satire likes to name names; it attracts ‘keys.’”114 In this

  </p>
  <p>
   aspect, Eudemia is no exception. Appendix A contains images of two manuscript keys
  </p>
  <p>
   that were created as an aid to readers for revealing the identities of the people behind
  </p>
  <p>
   the characters’ pseudonyms.115
  </p>
  <p>
   In the section above on Eudemia’s publication history where Rossi’s 1646 letter
  </p>
  <p>
   to Kaspar Schoppe was cited, in which he explains how the book came to be published
  </p>
  <p>
   in Leiden, we saw how Rossi situated his work within the genres of Menippean and
  </p>
  <p>
   verse satire. However, in that letter he is additionally claiming the genre of romantic
  </p>
  <p>
   fiction in the vein of Barclay’s most famous work, Argenis. Barclay’s novel tells the story
  </p>
  <p>
   of the princess Argenis, daughter of Meleander King of Sicily,116 who is secretly
  </p>
  <p>
   betrothed to Poliarchus but must fend off two other suitors, the valiant Archombrotus
  </p>
  <p>
   and the villain Radirobanes. The narrative arc of Argenis, with its plot driven by
  </p>
  <p>
   obstacles—including rivalries for her affection, pirates, shipwrecks, wars, conspiracies,
  </p>
  <p>
   poison, duplicity, and disguise—that separate the two lovers and delay their happiness,
  </p>
  <p>
   is typical of the romantic genre.117 In addition to being a romance, Argenis is a political
  </p>
  <p>
   allegory depicting the sixteenth-century wars of religion in France.118 Barclay combined
  </p>
  <p>
   the romantic and historical genres to create a wholly new one, the political romance,
  </p>
  <p>
   115 One of the keys is dated 1637 and states explicitly that it accompanies the first edition in eight books,
  </p>
  <p>
   and therefore only identifies the pseudonyms in those books. The other key, though it is sewn into a copy
  </p>
  <p>
   of the 1645 edition in ten books, similarly only identifies the pseudonyms in the first eight books,
  </p>
  <p>
   indicating that there may have been an exemplar key to the first edition that everyone was copying from.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s contemporary Cassiano Dal Pozzo mentions in his Memoriale romano (1875: 192) that Jean-
  </p>
  <p>
   Jacques Bouchard created a key for the characters in Eudemia (now lost): “n’haveva [il] sig. Iacopo
  </p>
  <p>
   Bouchard gentilhuomo francese penetrati molti di quei nomi, che credo resti la nota tra i suoi manoscritti”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“the French gentleman Jean-Jacques Bouchard got to the bottom of many of the names in it, and I
  </p>
  <p>
   believe these identifications are still among his papers”).

  </p>
  <p>
   45
  </p>
  <p>
   and did this so successfully and with such a high degree of artistry that his novel
  </p>
  <p>
   enjoyed enormous popularity, going through more than sixty editions, including
  </p>
  <p>
   translations into more than ten different languages.119
  </p>
  <p>
   Similarities between Eudemia and Argenis exist, but they are few in number. For
  </p>
  <p>
   example, both are extended works of Latin fiction combining prose and verse, both were
  </p>
  <p>
   written for an elite, intellectual audience and are replete with allusions to ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   literature, and both are romans à clef. On the whole, however, Rossi’s comparison of
  </p>
  <p>
   his work to Argenis is telling mostly in its inaccuracy. Most significantly, Eudemia is
  </p>
  <p>
   almost entirely void of romantic elements (the inserted tale of Olinda and Philotas in
  </p>
  <p>
   Book Four being the one exception). The protagonists are three men—the two Romans
  </p>
  <p>
   and their guide Gallonius—who harbor no romantic or sexual interest for each other.
  </p>
  <p>
   The episodic, haphazard plot has no overarching narrative structure and leads to no
  </p>
  <p>
   real conclusion. In addition, while Barclay, in the assessment of Mark T. Riley, treats the
  </p>
  <p>
   issues of his day in “an elevated and serious tone, a great imaginative power, and an
  </p>
  <p>
   acute judgment in the treatment of political and religious questions,”120 Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   observations about the inhabitants on the island of Eudemia are, on the whole, petty
  </p>
  <p>
   and mocking rather than insightful and advisory, and the situations he describes are
  </p>
  <p>
   either too specific and ludicrous, or too commonplace (e.g., attacks against priests and
  </p>
  <p>
   moneylenders), to be applied as general moral lessons. Even the two authors’ use of
  </p>
  <p>
   119 Morrish 2003: 238; Barclay, Riley, and Huber 2004: 3. For a list of the editions and translations of
  </p>
  <p>
   Argenis see Barclay, Riley, and Huber 2004: 51-8. For a detailed look at the sources for Argenis see ibid.:
  </p>
  <p>
   26-30.
  </p>
  <p>
   120 Barclay, Riley, and Huber 2004: 11.
  </p>
  <p>
   46
  </p>
  <p>
   the key technique differs significantly: As Riley explains, the main characters in
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclay’s Argenis
  </p>
  <p>
   perform the function played in the real world by certain persons, but they
  </p>
  <p>
   are not portraits of the persons themselves. Meleander, the king of Sicily .
  </p>
  <p>
   . . is not a portrait of Henry III of France, but a character who labors under
  </p>
  <p>
   the same kinds of difficulties as those of Henry III.121
  </p>
  <p>
   By contrast, a large number of the pseudonymous characters in Eudemia map onto
  </p>
  <p>
   specific historical people, most of whom were in his own circle of acquaintance (and a
  </p>
  <p>
   little over half of whom are profiled in his Pinacotheca).
  </p>
  <p>
   Because Rossi’s mocking and inconclusive Eudemia resembles Barclay’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon much more than it does his Argenis, it is telling that
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi does not specifically mention the Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon as his model,
  </p>
  <p>
   especially since we know that he read it. Rossi’s biography of John Barclay, included in
  </p>
  <p>
   the third book of his Pinacotheca, provides a clue as to why this might be the case:
  </p>
  <p>
   In iis [oratoribus], qui extra Urbem Romam, atque adeo extra Italiam,
  </p>
  <p>
   Latinis literis studium suum dederunt, Joan[nes] Barclajus numeratur,
  </p>
  <p>
   cujus ego legi Argedinem et partem etiam Euphormionis degustavi tum,
  </p>
  <p>
   cum nondum lata lex erat, ne bibliopolae cuipiam liceret eum vendere, aut
  </p>
  <p>
   cuiquam domi habere ac legere.122
  </p>
  <p>
   John Barclay is among those non-Roman and even non-Italian
  </p>
  <p>
   [rhetoricians] who have devoted themselves to the study of Latin letters. I
  </p>
  <p>
   have read his Argenis, and I have also had a taste of part of his
  </p>
  <p>
   Euphormio, before it was against the law for bookstores to sell it or for
  </p>
  <p>
   people to own it and read it at home.
  </p>
  <p>
   121 Ibid.: 24. Many of the supporting characters do represent real people, such as Ibburanes (Maffeo
  </p>
  <p>
   Barberini), Hieroleander (Girolamo Aleandro, the younger), and Nicopompus (John Barclay himself).
  </p>
  <p>
   122 Pinacotheca tertia 1648: 74. It is likely that Rossi knew Barclay personally while Barclay was living in
  </p>
  <p>
   Rome from 1615 to 1623, under the patronage of Pope Paul V and moving in the same literary circles
  </p>
  <p>
   (Barclay and Fleming 1973: xiv).
  </p>
  <p>
   47
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s mention of the limited access booksellers and consumers had to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon refers to the fact that Part Two of the work was placed
  </p>
  <p>
   on the Index of Prohibited Books almost immediately after its publication in 1607. This is
  </p>
  <p>
   because John Barclay, a Roman Catholic but a “partisan of British interests,” wrote
  </p>
  <p>
   critically of the Jesuits and of the Pope.123 Rossi does not specify whether the part of
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclay’s Satyricon he read was the first or the second, a portion of one or the other—or
  </p>
  <p>
   even of both—and it is also probable that Rossi had read the entire work but just could
  </p>
  <p>
   not say so publicly.124 In any case, comparing his work to Argenis, instead of to his
  </p>
  <p>
   more likely model Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon, benefited Rossi in two ways: he
  </p>
  <p>
   could distance himself from a controversial title; at the same time, by associating his
  </p>
  <p>
   work with an enormously popular and successful novel that, by the time of Eudemia’s
  </p>
  <p>
   1637 publication date, existed in at least thirteen Latin editions and twelve
  </p>
  <p>
   translations,125 he could make Eudemia more attractive to potential publishers,
  </p>
  <p>
   booksellers, and readers. Similar to his soft Horatian turn discussed above, Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   association of Eudemia with Barclay’s romance, as opposed to his harsh (and officially
  </p>
  <p>
   condemned) Euphormis Lusinini Satyricon, was a way to remove some of the bite from
  </p>
  <p>
   his work.
  </p>
  <p>
   123 Barclay and Fleming 1973: xiii
  </p>
  <p>
   124 A Papal Nuncio ordered all copies of the 1607 edition seized and destroyed, but another edition was
  </p>
  <p>
   published in 1609 (copying the 1607 edition) and circulated more widely despite its listing on the Index
  </p>
  <p>
   (Barclay and Fleming 1973: xiii-xiv, xxxv). In 1610 Barclay published a defense of his work titled
  </p>
  <p>
   Euphormionis Satyrici apologia pro se (Parisiis: Apud Franciscum Huby, 1610; often published as the
  </p>
  <p>
   third part of the Euphormionis Satyricon), in which he defends his work as an “innocentem ludum”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“innocent sport”) saying that his aim was to denounce many different shameful acts through a pleasing
  </p>
  <p>
   tale (“per suavitatem fabulae multa et disparia flagitia damnare”), and that he was impugning the whole
  </p>
  <p>
   world (“accusare totum orbem”) not any individual or group in particular (8-9). This tactic seems to have
  </p>
  <p>
   worked since, by 1615, Barclay had secured an invitation to Rome from Pope Paul V.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   48
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s Latin
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s Jesuit education was based on a Classical curriculum that provided him a
  </p>
  <p>
   solid foundation in the liberal arts. After completing his schooling, but finding it difficult to
  </p>
  <p>
   establish himself in a professional career, Rossi recommitted himself to humanistic
  </p>
  <p>
   study. He found his niche in the Accademia degli Umoristi, the intellectual and artistic
  </p>
  <p>
   community associated with the court of Urban VIII. To bolster his private studies, Rossi
  </p>
  <p>
   built up his own library of Classical authors, as is evident in a 1604 letter to the Flemish
  </p>
  <p>
   printer Jan Moretus, in which he asked Moretus to locate as many works as possible
  </p>
  <p>
   “qui ad humanitatis, ut vocant, studia pertineant” (“that relate to the humanities, as they
  </p>
  <p>
   are called”) and to send them to him.126 Authors such as Cicero, Plautus, Quintillian,
  </p>
  <p>
   Livy, Sallust, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Terence were the inspiration and models for his
  </p>
  <p>
   prose and poetry.127
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi mastered these studies and was recognized by his contemporaries as a
  </p>
  <p>
   superior Latinist, even surpassing certain renowned fourteenth- and fifteenth-century
  </p>
  <p>
   Italian humanists in the eyes of his friends. Gabriel Naudé, for example, wrote of Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin:
  </p>
  <p>
   quaecumque prosa aut versa oratione scribis, ita me capiunt et delectant
  </p>
  <p>
   omnia, ut prae te uno veteres meae deliciae Bembi et Politiani videantur
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi nunc illiberales esse et infecti, nempe meum mel spirat quidquid
  </p>
  <p>
   loqueris et ipsa Pytho tuis in labiis sessitat, ut quemadmodum in omni alia
  </p>
  <p>
   virtute veteres aemularis, ita etiam dicendi scribendique facultate ipsorum
  </p>
  <p>
   nemini concedes.128
  </p>
  <p>
   Everything you write, whether in prose or verse, so grabs and delights me
  </p>
  <p>
   that, compared to you, my former favorites Bembo and Poliziano now

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   seem base and unaccomplished. Everything you say inspires my pleasant
  </p>
  <p>
   speech. Pytho herself resides on your lips to such an extent that, in all of
  </p>
  <p>
   the ways you emulate the ancients in every other virtue, you too are
  </p>
  <p>
   second to none of them in speaking and writing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a dedication to Leone Allacci’s work De Templis Graecorum Recentioribus ad
  </p>
  <p>
   Ioannem Morinum, Barthold Nihus (Rossi’s editor) addresses Rossi as “Perillustri
  </p>
  <p>
   domino Iano Nicio Erythraeo, aevi nostri Varroni ac Tullio” (“To the most illustrious Ianus
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicius Erythraeus, the Varro and Tully of our time”).129
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s Latin continued to enjoy this sort of acclaim even after his death. In his
  </p>
  <p>
   Elogii d’huomini letterati Lorenzo Crasso (b. 1623) dedicated a profile to the
  </p>
  <p>
   “Gentilhuomo Romano chiamato Gio: Vittorio de’Rossi,” noting that he acquired through
  </p>
  <p>
   his studies “la purità della lingua Latina”130 (“purity of the Latin language”). The
  </p>
  <p>
   renowned German jurist and philosopher Johann Gottlieb Heineccius (1681-1741)
  </p>
  <p>
   singled Rossi out as one of the few humanists to have achieved Ciceronian eloquence,
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly in the epistolary arts.131 Prospero Mandosio (1643-1724) had similarly
  </p>
  <p>
   fulsome praise for Rossi’s Latin in his work on Roman authors titled Bibliotheca romana,
  </p>
  <p>
   seu Romanorum scriptorum centuriae:
  </p>

   Habuit elegantissimum, dulcissimum, amoenissimumque orationis genus‚

  </p>
  <p>
   gloriam debitam esse dicunt, quod pure‚ dilucide, ornate, eleganter, et
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   131 Heineccius (1743: 195) states the following in a section on letter writing in his work Fundamenta stili
  </p>
  <p>
   cultioris: “quae non eruditionis ostendendae, sed testandi amoris aut animorum conciliandorum caussa
  </p>
  <p>
   scribi solent, in quo genere scribendi Cicero, Plinius, Paullus Manutius, Marcus Antonius Muretus, Latinus

  </p>
  <p>
   wrote letters not to show off their erudition, but to bear witness to their love [of their friends] and to unite
  </p>
  <p>
   their minds [with those of their friends]. Cicero, Pliny, Paolo Manuzio, Marc Antoine Muret, Latino Latini,
  </p>
  <p>
   Giano Nicio Eritreo [i.e., Rossi], Aonio Paleario, and Peter van der Kun are the best in this genre”).
  </p>

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   [Rossi] had a most elegant, sweet, and pleasant way of speaking that was
  </p>
  <p>
   commended by every manner of praise from all quarters; they say that he
  </p>
  <p>
   earned this glory because he spoke Latin purely, pristinely, ornately,
  </p>
  <p>
   elegantly, and in a truly Latin manner, so much so that the wisest and
  </p>
  <p>
   most learned men said that whoever needed to learn to write Latin should
  </p>
  <p>
   learn that skill from Ianus Nicius Erythraeus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with these explicit statements of appreciation for Rossi’s prose, admiration
  </p>
  <p>
   for his Latin is evident in instances of unacknowledged imitation, especially in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   The German jurist, poet, and composer Kaspar Ziegler, for example, quotes almost
  </p>

   word for word from Rossi’s description of a dishonest soldier in the beginning of
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia Book Eight for a section of his discourse on the subject of unscrupulous
  </p>
  <p>
   lawyers (“rabulae”) titled Rabulistica, sive, De Artibus Rabulariis dissertatio.133 Similarly,
  </p>
  <p>
   the German Calvinist theologian and historian Daniel Gerdes quotes almost directly
  </p>
  <p>
   from Rossi’s description of a carpenter named Baldoccius in Book Six to describe a
  </p>
  <p>
   Minorite (a Franciscan friar of the Order of Friars Minor) named Franciscus in his
  </p>
  <p>
   Historia reformationis, sive, Annales evangelii seculo XVI.134
  </p>
  <p>
   Even into the nineteenth century some compendia of Latin texts included
  </p>
  <p>
   passages from Rossi’s work as exemplary specimens of Latin prose. For example, a

  <p>
   French publication from 1818, titled Leçons latines modernes de littérature et de morale,
  </p>
  <p>
   showcases as models two passages from Eudemia and one passage from Pinacotheca

  </p>
  <p>
   from 1825.135
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite his mastery of Ciceronian eloquence, Rossi became more and more
  </p>
  <p>
   drawn, as Gerboni explains, to the “conversar familiare” (conversational style) of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman playwrights Plautus and Terence, because he appreciated their humor, levity,
  </p>
  <p>
   and their ability to observe and represent everyday life and customs.136 To quote
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s own words:
  </p>
  <p>
   cepi rursus Ciceronem in manus sumere, ac frequentius etiam Plautum
  </p>
  <p>
   atque Terentium; cum nullius rei ita essem cupidus, ut hilaritatis
  </p>
  <p>
   laetitiaeque; quorum quasi cantu colorata mea tibi videri potest oratio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atque adeo me affici eorum lectione sentiebam, ut integrae paginae mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   in memoria haererent.137
  </p>
  <p>
   I began to take up Cicero again, and, even more frequently, Plautus and
  </p>
  <p>
   Terence, since I desired nothing more than their lightheartedness and
  </p>
  <p>
   joyfulness; you can tell that their poetry has colored my speech. I felt that
  </p>
  <p>
   reading these authors made such an impression on me that entire pages
  </p>
  <p>
   of their works have stuck in my memory.
  </p>
  <p>
   In writing prose satire with humorous situations and rapid-fire dialogue, humanist
  </p>
  <p>
   authors often looked to playwrights like Plautus and Terence to provide models of what
  </p>
  <p>
   Jürgen Leonhardt terms “unforced communication,” that is, informal, everyday language
  </p>
  <p>
   that reflects how people might have spontaneously communicated with each other in
  </p>
  <p>
   135 Noël and de Laplace 1818: 99-101, 460-462; Philippi 1825: 12-3, 17-18, 114-7. The Philippi book
  </p>
  <p>
   looks to be a translation or adaptation of Noel &amp; de Laplace since it contains the same passages.

  <p>
   private.138 Rossi’s mastery of this comic style is recognized in a note penned by Gabriel
  </p>
  <p>
   Naudé on a manuscript key to the 1637 edition of Eudemia:139
  </p>
  <p>
   Quod ad stylum attinet, vocabula omnia bona et de antiquiore purioreque
  </p>
  <p>
   Plauti atque Terentii Latinitate hausta, dictio non adeo nativa ac Romana,
  </p>
  <p>
   totum autem genus dicendi languidum humile ac velut humi serpens.
  </p>
  <p>
   Regarding his style, his entire vocabulary is of good quality, taken from the
  </p>
  <p>
   more ancient and pure Latinity of Plautus and Terence, his diction is not
  </p>
  <p>
   altogether native or Roman, but his entire way of speaking is unhurried,
  </p>
  <p>
   base, and as if it is crawling on the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s preference for Plautus is obvious in Eudemia where the Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   playwright is his most quoted author, with more than 130 direct citations (drawn mostly
  </p>
  <p>
   from, in order, Miles Gloriosus, Menaechmi, Pseudolus, and Curculio). Rossi’s penchant
  </p>
  <p>
   for examples of colloquial Latin from other authors besides Plautus is also evident:
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi quotes almost directly from Cicero (at least 88 times, mostly In Verrem, De
  </p>
  <p>
   oratore, and Brutus), Horace (at least 50 times, mostly from the Satires, Epistles, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Odes), and Terence (at least 46 times, mostly Eunuchus, Heauton Timorumenos,
  </p>
  <p>
   Andria, and Adelphoe). Other authors quoted in Eudemia are Ovid, Caesar, Sallust,
  </p>
  <p>
   Statius, and Seneca, as well as an extensive passage from the medieval author Alain
  </p>
  <p>
   de Lille.140
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, Rossi’s Latin is very clear and can be read using a standard Latin
  </p>
  <p>
   dictionary such as Lewis &amp; Short. Even his most obscure words are usually in the
  </p>
  <p>
   standard dictionary, although for a few words it was necessary to consult Du Cange,

  </p>
  <p>
   139 “Clavis et index in Eudemiam,” Houghton Library, Harvard University.
  </p>
  <p>
   140 In terms of frequency, my calculation differs from Maragoni (2005: 101), who lists Plautus as Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   fourth most frequently cited author (his first three are Cicero, Terence, and Caesar, with Horace in sixth
  </p>
  <p>
   place). I attribute this discrepancy to the fact that, because of my translation project, I have analyzed the
  </p>
  <p>
   work with more precision.
  </p>
  <p>
   53
  </p>
  <p>
   Glossarium Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis (for example, for the definition “ocularia”—
  </p>
  <p>
   “spectacles”). Rossi’s prose is generally easy to follow; his sentences are rarely very
  </p>
  <p>
   long, and even when they are, they are well structured with clear subordinating clauses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stylistically he is delightful, frequently indulging in copia verborum, which is a
  </p>
  <p>
   characteristic of Renaissance Latin comedy in general; indeed, Rossi seems to enjoy
  </p>
  <p>
   supplying every word in his lexical arsenal for something, especially when describing
  </p>
  <p>
   people’s characteristics. Good examples can be found in Book Two when he describes
  </p>
  <p>
   the prostitute Nanna as “subdola, blanda, fraudulenta, avara”; and in Book Six when he
  </p>
  <p>
   uses three different words to refer to Zancha the broker: “conciliator,” “intercessor,” and
  </p>
  <p>
   “proxeneta.” All in all, Gian Vittorio Rossi is a very approachable author.
  </p>
  <p>
   A few words about the spelling and typesetting conventions in the text are
  </p>
  <p>
   warranted. Both the 1637 Elzevier and the 1645 Blaeu editions reflect early modern
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin spelling conventions, for example “coelum” and “foetus” for the more Classical
  </p>
  <p>
   “caelum” and “fetus.” In addition, both editions distinguish between the vocalic “u” and
  </p>
  <p>
   “i” and their consonantal equivalents “v” and “j,” giving us spellings like “brevibus,”
  </p>
  <p>
   “ejus,” and “dejicere.” One difference, however, is that for the vocalic “u” in its capital
  </p>
  <p>
   letter form in the initial position, the 1637 edition has “u” (e.g., “Ubi”) where the 1645
  </p>
  <p>
   eidtion has “v” (e.g., “Vbi”). Both editions use the long “s” for lowercase letters in the
  </p>
  <p>
   initial and medial positions, giving us “ſine” “fuiſſe,” but “Sed” and “primus.” One
  </p>
  <p>
   important typesetting difference between the two editions is that the 1637 edition has
  </p>
  <p>
   frequent instances of abbreviation, so a final “m” often appears as a macron over the
  </p>
  <p>
   preceding vowel (“ignotū”), the dipthong “æ” sometimes appears as an “e”-cedilla, and
  </p>
  <p>
   “-q;” often stands in for “-que.” No such abbreviations appear in the 1645 edition.

   Eudemia: Story Outline and Themes
  </p>
  <p>
   Story Outline
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia is set around 31 CE in the immediate aftermath of the arrest and
  </p>
  <p>
   execution of Lucius Aelius Sejanus, commander of the Praetorian Guard, who was
  </p>
  <p>
   accused of trying to usurp power from Tiberius while the emperor was ruling in absentia
  </p>
  <p>
   from Capri (an event known as the Conspiracy of Sejanus). The protagonists, Flavius
  </p>
  <p>
   Vopiscus Niger and Paulus Aemilius Verus, flee Rome by sea but become shipwrecked
  </p>
  <p>
   on an island named Eudemia located off the coast of Mauritania. The story represents
  </p>
  <p>
   Flavius Vopiscus Niger’s first-person account of what the two Romans see and hear on
  </p>
  <p>
   the island.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Giachino observes, the first seven books of Eudemia reflect a week on the
  </p>
  <p>
   island, with each book describing a single day.141 The action in the eighth book (the
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusion of the 1637 editio princeps) describes the two protagonists’ voyage to a
  </p>
  <p>
   neighboring island and takes place over an unspecified period of time. The ninth book
  </p>
  <p>
   (of the two added to the 1645 edition) takes up the action after they have lived on the
  </p>
  <p>
   neighboring island for an indeterminate period. A summary of books one through eight
  </p>
  <p>
   is as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   Book one: Two Romans, Flavius Vopiscus Niger and Paulus Aemilius Verus,
  </p>
  <p>
   fleeing the aftermath of the Conspiracy of Sejanus, become shipwrecked on the island
  </p>
  <p>
   of Eudemia. They are befriended by Gallonius, steward to Plusius (the wealthiest man
  </p>
  <p>
   on the island), who becomes their guide. They learn from Gallonius that the island had
  </p>
  <p>
   been colonized two centuries earlier by the survivors of a trireme from the fleet of Scipio
  </p>
  <p>
   141 Giachino 2002: 207.
  </p>
  <p>
   55
  </p>
  <p>
   Africanus, which had been blown off course as it was returning from the Second Punic
  </p>
  <p>
   War. After generations of intermarriage, everyone on Eudemia now speaks Latin. The
  </p>
  <p>
   two Romans learn that the island is governed by ruling men called dynasts (dynastae),
  </p>
  <p>
   whom they witness being ferried about the city in opulent carriages. Gallonius brings
  </p>
  <p>
   them to the home of Dynast Bibulus, who keeps a menagerie of animals. On their way
  </p>
  <p>
   back to Gallonius’s house, the three men narrowly avoid being struck by a carriage
  </p>
  <p>
   carrying a noblewoman named Pasicompsa, widow of a dynast, prompting a digression
  </p>
  <p>
   on the insatiable libido of women who prey upon naïve young men.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book two: Gallonius takes the two Romans to visit the splendid gardens of one
  </p>
  <p>
   of the dynasts. Next they visit a friend of Gallonius, who has been taken ill and is being
  </p>
  <p>
   cared for by a woman, named Nanna, whom the Romans learn is a cunning and
  </p>
  <p>
   deceitful prostitute after the man’s money. They hear the story of how this woman had,
  </p>
  <p>
   with the help of a quack doctor, cleverly tricked a merchant into thinking he had injured
  </p>
  <p>
   her, for which harm she attempted to obtain monetary recompense. When the story
  </p>
  <p>
   concludes, the three men make their way to the home of Dynast Plusius. While lunch is
  </p>
  <p>
   being served to Plusius’s guests, the two Romans have the opportunity to observe the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynasts’ dress and to eavesdrop on their conversations. The Romans are then invited to
  </p>
  <p>
   take lunch in the beautiful gardens where they are joined by a raucous group of guests.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the feast has concluded, Gallonius is summoned to a magistrate’s chambers to aid
  </p>
  <p>
   a man named Toxillus, who has been dragged off to court. There they hear the story of
  </p>
  <p>
   a prostitute, allegedly a witch, who stands accused of using magic to attack the
  </p>
  <p>
   magistrate’s lictors. After the woman is cleared of wrongdoing, Gallonius persuades the
  </p>
  <p>
   magistrate to drop the charges against Toxillus. On their way home, the three men hear
  </p>
  <p>
   56
  </p>
  <p>
   the story of Asterius, who, via a clever play on words, gets revenge on the magistrate
  </p>
  <p>
   for an injustice.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book three: Gallonius takes the two Romans to visit a friend of his, who is
  </p>
  <p>
   anguished about being old and close to death. After an unsuccessful attempt to comfort
  </p>
  <p>
   his friend, Gallonius continues to lead his two guests on a tour of the city. In one of the
  </p>
  <p>
   marketplaces, they hear the story of a rag seller who has left his wife under the
  </p>
  <p>
   protection of men whom he thinks are bodyguards, but who are actually vying for her
  </p>
  <p>
   amorous attention. Gallonius promises his guests that, after lunch, he will take them to
  </p>
  <p>
   visit a literary academy. They spend the afternoon in the company of the elite and
  </p>
  <p>
   learned members of the academy listening to speeches and poems. That night they are
  </p>
  <p>
   awoken out of their sleep by cries coming from the hospital, where the staff is spending
  </p>
  <p>
   a miserable night on account of the explosive effects of bad wine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book four: The three men receive news that the eminent Dynast Alexander has
  </p>
  <p>
   died. Alexander’s greatness is contrasted with the story of another man, despised by all,
  </p>
  <p>
   who died and was buried in a tomb—but the man turned out not to be dead. At the
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusion of the story, the three men return to Gallonius’s house, where they overhear
  </p>
  <p>
   the household servants engaged in gossip. During lunch, the Romans engage with a
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher in a debate about the chastity of Lucretia. That afternoon, they head out
  </p>
  <p>
   from Gallonius’s house and come across a funeral taking place for a certain young man
  </p>
  <p>
   named Philotas. The Romans hear the sad tale of two star-crossed lovers, Philotas and
  </p>
  <p>
   Olinda. The two Romans then witness the funeral of Dynast Alexander. Before dinner
  </p>
  <p>
   they are introduced to a ship’s captain, who will take them the following day to a
  </p>
  <p>
   neighboring island. As they head back to Gallonius’s house, they encounter a man who
  </p>
  <p>
   57
  </p>
  <p>
   claims to be a poet superior to Virgil. They next encounter a tedious philosopher, who
  </p>
  <p>
   instructs them in his abbreviated method of learning rhetoric.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book five: The two Romans visit the buleuterium (senate house) to see the
  </p>
  <p>
   poliarchs (senators) in action hearing complaints from fishmongers, poultry sellers, and
  </p>
  <p>
   other merchants, and administering justice. On their way they learn about the common
  </p>
  <p>
   practice of husbands turning a blind eye to their wives’ lovers if some benefit accrues to
  </p>
  <p>
   them in the form of lavish gifts. The Romans are invited by the poliarchs to join them for
  </p>
  <p>
   lunch. At the conclusion of the banquet, the men admire the art in the senate house. On
  </p>
  <p>
   their way home, they meet Aridus, who recounts stories about various people in
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia: a man whose son and daughter are, respectively, a handsome and
  </p>
  <p>
   accomplished troublemaker and a famous courtesan; a thieving banker named Lyco;
  </p>
  <p>
   and a miserly cloth merchant, named Harpax, and a dishonest banker, named Septimus
  </p>
  <p>
   Pleusippus, both of whom defraud their clients and creditors. Next, they hear from
  </p>
  <p>
   Iberus about a clever plan to ensure his immortality. When they return to Gallonius’s
  </p>
  <p>
   house, the two Romans chastise him for being angry at his ungrateful master, because
  </p>
  <p>
   he should know better than to expect anything but ingratitude from members of the
  </p>
  <p>
   ruling class. Gallonius then recounts the woeful tale of Nicius Rufus, a long-suffering
  </p>
  <p>
   secretary to a miserly dynast.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book six: Because the two Romans are in need of money, Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   accompanies them to the forum to meet with Zancha the broker in order to sell some of
  </p>
  <p>
   their valuables before setting sail to the neighboring island. Zancha recounts the story of
  </p>
  <p>
   the drunkard carpenter Baldoccius, whose daughter, Tensa, fools both him and her
  </p>
  <p>
   mother, Antina, into leaving her at home alone, so she can meet freely with her lover,
  </p>
  <p>
   58
  </p>
  <p>
   Pamphilus. On their way home, the two Romans encounter a solemn religious
  </p>
  <p>
   procession and learn about how members of the ruling class of Eudemia hold their
  </p>
  <p>
   horses and other pets in higher esteem than they do their fellow man. After breakfast
  </p>
  <p>
   they rush to board the ship. Aboard the ship they meet a painter named Ballio who, with
  </p>
  <p>
   his wife, wants to set sail with them, and a moneylender who rails against the wife
  </p>
  <p>
   because she was once a whore. Ballio then recounts the story of a Cynic philosopher
  </p>
  <p>
   named Lyus, whose sister, a chaste maiden, has been on pious pilgrimages all over the
  </p>
  <p>
   world. Her reputation precedes her, and noblewomen throughout the land compete to
  </p>
  <p>
   host her in their homes and in their beds, until a rich widow unveils her true identity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book seven: A violent wind blows the ship back to Eudemia whence it departed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The two Romans disembark and seek out their friend Gallonius. They all commiserate
  </p>
  <p>
   about a certain disagreeable old man named Ligurinus. The two Romans learn about
  </p>
  <p>
   the archaeologist Offuscatus, who devotes his life to exploring Eudemia’s catacombs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Offuscatus incurs the jealously of Plusius Accipiter, who thinks Offuscatus is treasure
  </p>
  <p>
   hunting and enriching himself with his finds; this prompts Offuscatus to conspire with a
  </p>
  <p>
   certain Stylius to play a trick on Plusius. On their way to a bookshop, the two Romans
  </p>
  <p>
   and Gallonius hear about a pair of swindlers, who use a beautiful young man as a
  </p>
  <p>
   honeypot to trick rich men into paying them a ransom. At the bookshop they hear about
  </p>
  <p>
   various men gifted in letters, art, and science. They also hear the story of wicked, filthy
  </p>
  <p>
   old man named Merlinus, who aids a penniless youth in engaging the services of a
  </p>
  <p>
   prostitute. Next, they hear the story of Rufus the clerk, whose servant spends the
  </p>
  <p>
   household money entrusted to him and disguises himself as a wealthy man in order to
  </p>
  <p>
   play a trick on his master. Next they listen to the story of a widow, who goes before a
  </p>
  <p>
   59
  </p>
  <p>
   judge to recoup money she has loaned to a dishonest neighbor. While waiting at the
  </p>
  <p>
   port to set sail, they hear various tales of fraudsters feigning religious frenzy in order to
  </p>
  <p>
   trick people into thinking they are possessed by demons for profit. They also meet a
  </p>
  <p>
   young surgeon, who has been thrown out of his house for causing his father to
  </p>
  <p>
   inadvertently eat a human liver. They then hear the story of a philosopher and adherent
  </p>
  <p>
   of the cult of Minerva, who seduces the maidservant of a nobleman’s wife. They also
  </p>
  <p>
   come across the old man Merlinus again in the act of attempting to recoup his money
  </p>
  <p>
   from a prostitute.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book eight: On board the ship, they hear the story of a dishonest soldier who
  </p>
  <p>
   tricks people into believing he is able to manufacture gold and then uses that supposed
  </p>
  <p>
   power as collateral for obtaining loans and stealing other people’s riches—until his ruse
  </p>
  <p>
   is exposed. Next, they hear the story of Geta, who finds a clever way to recoup the
  </p>
  <p>
   money he has spent buying gifts for his beloved. They then hear the story of a sexton of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Temple of Apollo who is being transported in chains to his punishment for stealing a
  </p>
  <p>
   young man’s beloved falcon and holding it ransom in exchange for sexual favors. At the
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusion of this story they hear a poem against wanton love affairs. The next person
  </p>
  <p>
   they meet offers his expertise in where and how to indulge in all of the illicit pleasures
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia has to offer. Next Paulus Aemilius is able to find a clever solution to the plights
  </p>
  <p>
   of two men who have each been wronged by their wives. When they arrive at their
  </p>
  <p>
   destination, they hear the story of Dynast Vius, who is so taken by his fondness for a
  </p>
  <p>
   dishonest young man that not even his brother-in-law Megalobulus is able to persuade
  </p>
  <p>
   him that the young man deserves punishment. Finally, the two Romans arrive at the
  </p>
  <p>
   neighboring island and discover a land that is fertile, abundant, and inhabited by law-
  </p>
  <p>
   60
  </p>
  <p>
   abiding and welcoming people who are all equal under the law. They decide to settle
  </p>
  <p>
   there and procure a villa on a high hill with a farm to sustain them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Themes
  </p>
  <p>
   Many of the themes found in Eudemia are standard fare for early modern satire.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Fleming says of Barclay’s Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon, commonplaces in
  </p>
  <p>
   humanistic satire include “comments on education, decline of learning, medicine,
  </p>
  <p>
   nobility, Puritans, and friars.”142 Rossi, too, aims at well-worn targets, including the
  </p>
  <p>
   nobility, quack doctors, priests, moneylenders, religious orders (especially Jesuits),
  </p>
  <p>
   charlatans, and tedious philosophers. His sharpest criticisms are reserved for inept and
  </p>
  <p>
   powerless magistrates; social climbers who advance by bribes, relationships, and favors
  </p>
  <p>
   (as opposed to by skill and competence); arrogant and incompetent poets; and
  </p>
  <p>
   promoters of the supernatural, including astrology, pseudoapparitions,
  </p>
  <p>
   pseudopossessions, and exorcisms.143
  </p>
  <p>
   Prostitutes, noblewomen, and lower-class women also populate Rossi’s satire,
  </p>
  <p>
   prompting Virginia Cox to include Eudemia in what she calls the “seventeenth-century
  </p>
  <p>
   misogynistic canon.”144 His portrayal of women as promiscuous and/or deceitful is
  </p>
  <p>
   conventional to both ancient and early modern literature, and a few of the female
  </p>
  <p>
   characters, such as Pasicompsa and Melphidippa, are simply stock characters whose
  </p>
  <p>
   names even derive from Plautus’s plays. In fact, Rossi insists that the inspiration for the
  </p>
  <p>
   142 Barclay and Fleming 1973: xxxi.
  </p>
  <p>
   143 Giachino 2002: 203-5; see also Correard 2016: 64-5.
  </p>
  <p>
   144 Cox 2008: 183.
  </p>
  <p>
   61
  </p>
  <p>
   character Pasicompsa (whose name means “adorned” or “well-dressed”) is drawn
  </p>
  <p>
   directly from Cicero’s Pro Caelio:
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum ea, quae impura ac flagitiosa narrantur, non omnia excepta sunt ex
  </p>
  <p>
   moribus, quibus nunc utimur, sed nonnulla etiam, ex veterum flagitiosorum
  </p>
  <p>
   hominum vita, delecta ut illud, de Pasicompsa et Cleobulo, in quo,
  </p>
  <p>
   mendaciuncula quibusdam aspersis, irae inimicitaeque exponuntur, quae
  </p>
  <p>
   inter Clodiam, foeminam nobilissimam locupletissimamque, et inter M.
  </p>
  <p>
   Caelium, procera statura, eleganti forma et candido ore adolescentem,
  </p>
  <p>
   intercedebat. Qui locus, ex Ciceronis oratione pro M. Caelio, iisdem pene
  </p>
  <p>
   verbis, in nostrum librum translatus est totus.145
  </p>
  <p>
   Then there’s the fact that the stories that are considered filthy and
  </p>
  <p>
   disgraceful are not all taken from our current customs, but some are also
  </p>
  <p>
   taken from the lives of disgraceful people in antiquity, like the one I
  </p>
  <p>
   selected about Pasicompsa and Cleobulus, in which I expose, with some
  </p>
  <p>
   fabrications sprinkled here and there, the anger and enmity that rose
  </p>
  <p>
   between the wealthy noblewoman Clodia and the tall, handsome and fair
  </p>
  <p>
   Marcus Caelius. That passage was taken entirely, almost word for word,
  </p>
  <p>
   from Cicero’s oration in defense of Marcus Caelius.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, some of the female characters are among the most
  </p>
  <p>
   developed and interesting in the entire novel (while their male counterparts are often
  </p>
  <p>
   greedy and dim-witted). The most resourceful and clever women in the narrative are
  </p>
  <p>
   Nanna (Book One), Tensa (Book Six), and Olinda (Book Four). Nanna is the only one of
  </p>
  <p>
   the three women whom the Romans themselves meet within the main narrative
  </p>
  <p>
   (Tensa’s and Olinda’s stories are narrated to them by others). She is described as a
  </p>
  <p>
   cunning whore who devises an ingenious ruse to trick a merchant out of his money.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tensa is a carpenter’s daughter who convinces her parents that her lover is a ghost
  </p>
  <p>
   haunting their house so she can rendezvous with him without arousing suspicion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olinda, unlike the other women, is tragic and sympathetic as opposed to tricky and
  </p>
  <p>
   deceitful, and her insert tale reads like a romance, with separated lovers and an
  </p>
  <p>
   145 Ep. ad div. 2.VI.V.
  </p>
  <p>
   62
  </p>
  <p>
   obstacle-filled journey toward a hoped-for reunification that is never realized. The plot
  </p>
  <p>
   twist that makes this tale particularly interesting is that, while she is searching for her
  </p>
  <p>
   lover Philotas, Olinda dresses in men’s clothing, thus attracting the amorous attention of
  </p>
  <p>
   a young maiden. When Olinda reveals her true identity, the maiden is not put off, but
  </p>
  <p>
   instead follows Olinda in search of Philotas. Olinda is so distraught by the
  </p>
  <p>
   circumstances in which they find him that she falls ill and dies, causing the lovesick
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden to fall ill and die as well. Olinda’s journey ends with the two women being buried
  </p>
  <p>
   together in the Temple of Cupid:
  </p>
  <p>
   ambarumque cadavera eodem die, eodem funere, eodem feretro in
  </p>
  <p>
   aedem Cupidinis elata sunt atque una eademque sepultura affecta ut,
  </p>
  <p>
   quarum animos amor in vita junxisset, mors distrahere non potuisset,
  </p>
  <p>
   earum corpora unum atque idem sepulchrum haberet.
  </p>
  <p>
   and the bodies of both women were carried to the Temple of Cupid on the
  </p>
  <p>
   same day, in the same funeral procession, in the same coffin, and one
  </p>
  <p>
   and the same burial was conducted so that death would not be able to put
  </p>
  <p>
   asunder the souls that love had joined together in life, and that one and
  </p>
  <p>
   the same tomb would house their bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other topics are unique to Rossi’s circumstance and allow the reader to ascribe a
  </p>
  <p>
   certain level of autobiography to Eudemia. These include the many individuals from
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s own circle who populate his narrative, whose true identities are clearly
  </p>
  <p>
   discernible behind their pseudonyms. A few examples are the two characters named
  </p>
  <p>
   Offuscatus, one standing in for the epigrapher Giovanni Zaratino Castellini (Book
  </p>
  <p>
   Three), and the other standing in for the archaeologist Antonio Bosio (Book Seven);
  </p>
  <p>
   Thaumantius, which refers to the bookseller Giovanni Battista Tamantini (Book Seven);
  </p>
  <p>
   the noble Tyrrhenus, the pseudonym for Fabio Chigi (Book Three); and Dynast Plusius,
  </p>
  <p>
   who conceals the identity of Cardinal Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto, Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   erstwhile and allegedly unappreciative employer (introduced in Book One and
  </p>
  <p>
   63
  </p>
  <p>
   appearing throughout). Rossi also includes venues and locations that would have been
  </p>
  <p>
   familiar to his readers, such as the meeting of a literary academy in Book Three,
  </p>
  <p>
   instantly recognizable as the Accademia degli Umoristi; a reference to the Ospedale
  </p>
  <p>
   Santo Spirito in Rome’s Borgo neighborhood (Book Three); the Muro Torto and the
  </p>
  <p>
   Campidoglio (Book Five); and the many fountains adorning the city, for which for
  </p>
  <p>
   inhabitants of Rossi’s Rome had Gianlorenzo Bernini to thank.
  </p>
  <p>
   A recurring target of Rossi’s satire is the literary and intellectual scene of his day.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two memorable instances occur in Book Four when the two Romans encounter an
  </p>
  <p>
   arrogant poet who thinks Virgil is overrated, and a tedious philosopher who has
  </p>
  <p>
   developed an efficient way to quickly and easily memorize the rules of rhetoric. The
  </p>
  <p>
   most pointed and withering criticism of an individual occurs in Book Seven, when Rossi
  </p>
  <p>
   takes aim at a certain unnamed author,
  </p>
  <p>
   quem nuper nescio quod volumen de illustribus sui aevi scriptoribus
  </p>
  <p>
   edidisse ajebant. Cui: “Non te puduit, inquit, ad tot illustrium virorum
  </p>
  <p>
   numerum Jani culcitrarum concinnatoris nomen adscribere? Non fuit
  </p>
  <p>
   religio, plebeias idiotae nescio cujus cantilenas . . . cum tot egregiis
  </p>
  <p>
   praestantium virorum operibus componere? Fortasse, quia tibi culcitram
  </p>
  <p>
   gratis effecit, dignus visus est, qui in doctorum hominum numerum veniat.”
  </p>
  <p>
   who they were saying had recently published some sort of book about
  </p>
  <p>
   famous writers of his age. A man said to him: “Were you not ashamed to
  </p>
  <p>
   add the name of Janus the mattress maker to your list of illustrious men?
  </p>
  <p>
   Did you have no scruples when you were compiling the common ditties of
  </p>
  <p>
   some idiot . . . alongside so many outstanding works of excellent men?
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps he seemed worthy of being included in the ranks of learned men
  </p>
  <p>
   because he made you a free mattress.”
  </p>
  <p>
   With this critical anecdote Rossi was taking aim at Leone Allacci, a theologian and
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar of Greek origin and fellow academy member.146 The work alluded to in this
  </p>
  <p>
   146 Allacci served as librarian to Francesco Barberini and was later appointed keeper of the Vatican
  </p>
  <p>
   Library by Alexander VII (Fabio Chigi).
  </p>
  <p>
   64
  </p>
  <p>
   passage was Allacci’s book titled Apes urbanae, sive, De viris illustribus qui ab anno
  </p>
  <p>
   1630 per totum 1632 Romae adfuerunt ac typis aliquid evulgarunt (Romae: Ludovicus
  </p>
  <p>
   Grignanus, 1633). In this book Allacci made the grave error, in Rossi’s opinion, of
  </p>
  <p>
   including an author and artist named Giovanni Bricci,147 son of a mattress maker and
  </p>
  <p>
   scrap dealer, in his list of “illustrious men.”148 In criticizing Allacci for his all-too-generous
  </p>
  <p>
   assessment of who merits recognition as a worthy artist or writer in Rome, Rossi was
  </p>
  <p>
   also expressing a broader critique of the diminishing literary and artistic standards of his
  </p>
  <p>
   contemporaries. It is this critique that leads Giachino to conclude that one of the
  </p>
  <p>
   inspirations for Eudemia was Rossi’s sense of indignation at the failure of the promised
  </p>
  <p>
   moral and cultural renovatio of the Barberini papacy that began so auspiciously under
  </p>
  <p>
   the “Cicero pontifex maximus,” as discussed above.149
  </p>
  <p>
   147 De Gregori 1942: 271; Giachino 2002: 198.
  </p>
  <p>
   148 Rossi felt compelled to apologize to Allacci in a 1638 letter (Ep. ad div. 1.V.XI). Rossi’s apology, and a
  </p>
  <p>
   correction of the record, is reflected in Book Nine of the 1645 Eudemiae libri decem, in an episode
  </p>
  <p>
   involving a character named Pterotius: “Hic vir longe doctissimus ille est, qui . . . in cujusdam inepti
  </p>
  <p>
   reprehensionem incurrerat, quod ad litteratorum hujus aevi numerum Ianum quendam scriptorem
  </p>
  <p>
   comoediarum aggregasset. Atque de hoc Iano, cum diligentius inquireremus, invenimus eum quidem
  </p>
  <p>
   humili loco natum, sed ingenio alto atque praestanti, ab ineunte aetate a parente qui nihil altum, nihil se
  </p>
  <p>
   ipso majus animo conciperet . . . traditam sibi artem respuisse libero ingenuoque fastidio, atque ad
  </p>
  <p>
   praestantiora studia animum adjecisse eo ardore, ea vi ut solus sine magistro, sine duce, naturae tantum
  </p>
  <p>
   bono ductus, non postremum picturae, poesis ac musicae gradum attigerit” (“[Pterotius ] a very learned
  </p>
  <p>
   man who . . . incurred the censure of some fool because he had included a certain writer named Janus in
  </p>
  <p>
   a list of intellectuals of our age. When we had done more research into this Janus, we found that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   indeed been born into a humble station but, despite his great and outstanding intellect, from a very young
  </p>
  <p>
   age he was steered by his father—who could conceive in his mind nothing lofty or nothing greater than
  </p>
  <p>
   himself—toward that trade which he himself knew and practiced . . . Janus rejected the family trade with
  </p>
  <p>
   frank and outspoken contempt, and he threw himself into more excellent subjects with such zeal and
  </p>
  <p>
   force that he alone, without a teacher, and led only by the gifts of nature, achieved a mastery of painting,
  </p>
  <p>
   poetry, and music”). Some of the language in Book Nine that refers to Janus (Bricci) is similar to that in
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s apology letter to Allacci, which suggests that he used the language in his letter as a basis for the
  </p>
  <p>
   passage Eudemia: “de [Iano] palinodiam, ut dicitur, cecini, atque eum tradidi, sine magistro, sine duce,
  </p>
  <p>
   naturae tam bono, ad aliquam, nec vulgarem, picturae, musices ac poesis noticiam pervenisse.”

  </p>
  <p>
   65
  </p>
  <p>
   As Laura Alemanno explains, after initially being directly involved in Rome’s
  </p>
  <p>
   thriving cultural institutions such as the Accademia degli Umoristi and the Accademia
  </p>
  <p>
   dei Lincei—both both in terms of patronage and their own literary activity and interest—
  </p>
  <p>
   Urban VIII and his powerful family began to distance themselves from the academies
  </p>
  <p>
   and their members.150 This turning away from cultural matters was prompted by the
  </p>
  <p>
   Thirty Years War, which forced the papacy, in Alemanno’s words, to “ridimensionare i
  </p>
  <p>
   suoi progetti di autonomia e contribuirono ad indebolire la centralità di Roma come
  </p>
  <p>
   punto di riferimento politico-culturale” (“reconsider its intention to remain independent [of
  </p>
  <p>
   the politics in Europe], and it contributed to a weakening of Rome as a political and
  </p>
  <p>
   cultural reference point”).151 Concrete expressions of this rift between the Barberini and
  </p>
  <p>
   the academies were, for example, the placement of Giambattista Marino’s Adone on the
  </p>
  <p>
   Index of Prohibited Books in 1627 and the trial of Galileo Galilei in 1633.
  </p>
  <p>
   The negative reaction of Rome’s intellectuals to their city’s declining importance
  </p>
  <p>
   on the global stage was reflected in their artistic output. A direct response to the
  </p>
  <p>
   treatment of Marino and Galilei was the vocal support the two men received from their
  </p>
  <p>
   colleagues, the independent-minded members of the Umoristi and the Lincei, in spite of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Church’s condemnation of these two high-profile intellectuals.152 On a more general
  </p>
  <p>
   150 Alemanno 1995: 113-4.
  </p>
  <p>
   151 Ibid.: 113.
  </p>
  <p>
   152 Upon Marino’s death in 1625, members of the Accademia degli Umoristi recognized their one-time
  </p>
  <p>
   Principe in an epitaph dedicated to “viro ingenii acumine eloquentiae suavitate scribendi elegantia
  </p>
  <p>
   praestantissimo” (“a most outstanding man in terms of sharpness of intellect, pleasantness of speech,
  </p>
  <p>
   and elegance in writing”). For the full text of the epitaph see Mirollo 1963: 93; for a summary of the critical
  </p>
  <p>
   reception of Marino see ibid.: 92-111. Girolamo Aleandro, member of the Accademia degli Umoristi and
  </p>
  <p>
   the person to whom both editions of Eudemia are dedicated, published Difesa dell'Adone, poema del
  </p>
  <p>
   cavaliere Marini (In Venetia: Appresso G. Scaglia, 1629). Rossi includes both Marino and Galilei as
  </p>
  <p>
   characters in Eudemia, in Books Three and Ten, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   66
  </p>
  <p>
   level, Alemanno notes that, beginning in the 1630s, the papal court began to be
  </p>
  <p>
   characterized in literature not as a locus for serene, cordial relationships but as a place
  </p>
  <p>
   replete with jealousy, duplicity, and hatred; in addition, the decade between 1630 and
  </p>
  <p>
   1640 sees a higher tolerance for satirical works that reflect poorly on Urban VIII and his
  </p>
  <p>
   court.153 Rossi’s 1637 satire is clearly a product of this sentiment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Conclusion
  </p>
  <p>
   As was stated at the outset, it was Gerboni’s assessment that the principal
  </p>
  <p>
   driving force behind the composition of Eudemia was Rossi’s resentment of the
  </p>
  <p>
   nepotism that colored the papacies not just of Urban VIII but of Paul V and Gregory XV
  </p>
  <p>
   before him, under whose rule Rossi lived the entirety of his adult life, and caused him to
  </p>
  <p>
   experience nothing but frustration in his attempts to gain a permanent position within the
  </p>
  <p>
   papal court.154 Because of this, he was forced to accept the thankless position as
  </p>
  <p>
   private secretary to Cardinal Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s resentment for having to accept this position—and his general rancor and
  </p>
  <p>
   disillusionment toward his society—is best summed up in what is perhaps the most
  </p>
  <p>
   personal episode in this highly personal work: a story told in Book Five about Dynast
  </p>
  <p>
   Plusius (pseudonym for Cardinal Peretti), who employs a private secretary named
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicius Rufus, described as “honesto loco natus ac litteris deditus” (“born to a reputable
  </p>
  <p>
   social rank and devoted to letters”). This is the woeful tale of an unappreciative, brutish,
  </p>
  <p>
   and suspicious employer who demeans his private secretary by forcing him to live in
  </p>
  <p>
   conditions of great discomfort and inconvenience, even after Nicius Rufus has spent
  </p>
  <p>
   153 Ibid.: 114, 116.
  </p>
  <p>
   154 Gerboni 1899: 48.
  </p>
  <p>
   67
  </p>
  <p>
   almost fifteen years in the nobleman’s service. The proximity of the pseudonym Nicius
  </p>
  <p>
   Rufus to his own name, Vittorio Rossi, cannot but invite this association and lead the
  </p>
  <p>
   reader to see Rufus-Rossi as the victim of a society in which status is granted through
  </p>
  <p>
   favors and friendships rather than talent and hard work, and to see the island of
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia—and by association Urban VIII’s Rome—as that society writ large.

  <p>
   Loci amoenitas et lassitudo fessos ad requiem vocabat; sed fames et cupiditas
  </p>
  <p>
   cognoscendi quo coelo tegeremur, quodque hominum genus ea loca teneret, progredi
  </p>
  <p>
   longius cogebat. Sed vix millia repsimus tria,4 cum nova rerum facies se offert: loca
  </p>
  <p>
   horrida, inculta, vepribus ac spinis obsita; speluncae in incredibilem altitudinem
  </p>
  <p>
   depressae; aditus asperi ac perangusti, modo ascensus, modo descensus, atque in
  </p>
  <p>
   praecipitia. Sed haec quoque incommoda evadimus et in aequatam agri planiciem
  </p>
  <p>
   devenimus. Rursus flores lectissimi, aquae perennes, arbores procerrimae ac
  </p>
  <p>
   viridissimae, et in summa ejus agri planicie horti perpetua macerie conclusi
  </p>
  <p>
   conspiciuntur. In quorum aditu hoc hexastichon capitalibus litteris affabre insculptum
  </p>
  <p>
   perlegimus:
  </p>
  <p>
   Praecipites inter quas nunc Lucania montes
  </p>
  <p>
   Delicias nutrit, visere quisquis amas,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ne loca praeruptis mirere horrentia saxis,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et sterilem denso robore fessus humum:
  </p>

  <p>
   Et quia loci cultus et elegantia spem dabat brevi affuturum, qui nos certos faceret quo
  </p>
  <p>
   sub caelo aut quibus in regionibus animam duceremus, membra longo itinere defatigata
  </p>
  <p>
   in herba projecimus, sub umbra quam multae atque procerae ulmi, ad opacandum eum
  </p>
  <p>
   locum patulis diffusae ramis, efficiebant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nec spes fefellit. Nam haud ita multo post magno cum strepitu, pessula ingentia
  </p>

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   projecit.” “Quid audio? inquit ille, Sejanus conjuravit in Caesarem? At me Sejanus olim

  </p>
  <p>
   cecidit mihi sane res non infeliciter. Non enim deferri quoquam poteram, ubi vellem
  </p>
  <p>
   esse libentius quam in hac insula. Nam inveni hic homines voluptuarios multos, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   gutturi deditos et, quod rem continet, praeter nonnulla vocabula Graeca, omnes Latine
  </p>
  <p>
   loquentes. Etenim, qua tempestate Scipionem Africanum in Africam trajicientem, cum
  </p>
  <p>
   adversa tempestate conflictatum esse Caelius enarrat, ajunt, duas Romanorum militum
  </p>
  <p>
   triremes, vi ventorum a ceteris avulsas, fuisse in hoc litus abstractas. Sed milites in

  <p>
   terram egressos, incolae hujus insulae benigne et humaniter exceperunt ac primum
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   lingua paulatim omissa, Latine loqui coeperunt. At fuere praeclara ingenia, quae cum se
  </p>
  <p>
   ad scribendum contulissent, egregia ac praeclara multa, tum soluta oratione, tum

   Caesaris et aliorum hujus notae auctorum, scripta aspicienda potestas accessit; quos
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Atque haec una est ex insulis Mauretaniae, Eudemia nomine. Sed interea, dum regionis

   Sed quamvis hic apud eos honos longe maximus habeatur, adeo ut supra addi nihil

  <p>
   possit, attamen si quis eum promerere studeat, huic homini pauci deos propitios,

  <p>
   plerique iratos putant. Nam praestare ajunt multo unum diem in summis voluptatibus

  </p>
  <p>
   sunt uxoribus praediti. Iis enim, diis hominibusque omnibus approbantibus, licitum est
  </p>
  <p>
   suo arbitratu vivere, voluptatibus indulgere, longe sumptibus progredi. Iis permissum
  </p>
  <p>
   videtur, ut ex pecuniis, quas ex pinguibus sacerdotiis, quibus praediti sunt, colligunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   uxoribus in redimiculum praebeant, in collum, in crines; ut eisdem domos ac villas in

  <p>
   urbium modum aedificent, Attalicis peristromatis ornent, supellectile aurea instituant

   maritis fruantur. Sed omnes simul Dynastae, tum coelibes, tum ii, quibus sunt uxores et
  </p>
  <p>
   liberi, de omnibus controversiis publicis una cum Rege constituunt, sacrificia procurant,

  <p>
   ille: “Non hos modo, inquit, hortos sed etiam circumjectos hortis campos ille possidet,
  </p>
  <p>
   cui ego meas operas locavi. Hic est Dynasta Plusius, copiis, auctoritate atque opibus
  </p>
  <p>
   ceterorum facile princeps. Hic artis coquinariae, cujus peritissimus habeor, in primis

  <p>
   Aemilius, si tibi est ocium, et si dominus nevult, duc nos quantum potest in hortos istos;

  <p>
   cupimus hercle eos aspicere.” “Ut lubet, inquit ille. Nam et ego ociosus sum, et domino

   esse causam ejus festinationis suspicatus: “Nuncia, inquit, domino tuo, jam ibi me

  <p>
   Si fugiunt anni more cadentis aquae.
  </p>
  <p>
   Si vix orta aetas est, cum sua funera sentit,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quod datur exiguum tempus, abibit iners?20

  </p>
  <p>
   Sola manet virtus, rapidis immobilis annis;
  </p>
  <p>
   Caetera nativo pondere pressa ruunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Et quia anni fervidissimum tempus erat, credo aucupandi frigoris causa, multi viri
  </p>
  <p>
   nobiles, multique etiam qui vespere vivunt suo,21 celeberrimas urbis vias, largifluos
  </p>
  <p>
   fontes, latissimas plateas equis rhedisque vecti reptabant. Sed oculos in primis nostros
  </p>
  <p>
   quorundam ad se splendor attraxit, qui rhedis multo fulgentibus auro ostroque delati,
  </p>
  <p>
   quacunque pergerent, turbare ac permiscere omnia videbantur. Nam eorum
  </p>
  <p>
   circumpedes turbam submovere; equos, asinos, carros obviam venientes expellere,
  </p>
  <p>
   praeterea cunctos tanquam Diis de caelo delapsis illis assurgere, decedere, capita
  </p>
  <p>
   aperire, in genua procumbere, equos ac rhedas sistere. Quod cum nos Gallonius eo
  </p>
  <p>
   splendore quasi perstrictos mirari adspiceret: “Nolite mirari, inquit, hi sunt Dynastae illi,
  </p>
  <p>
   quos dixi. Videtisne ut iis honor habeatur, tanquam praesentibus Diis?” “Vah! inquam,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui cultus! quae luxuries! at Romae nemo senator, nemo consul, ac ne Tiberius quidem,
  </p>
  <p>
   rerum dominus, hujus opulentiae luxu decoratur. Nam ille in omni cultu vix civilem
  </p>
  <p>
   modum excedit.” Hoc interim spacio ad aedes magni illius viri venimus, vestibulum et
  </p>
  <p>
   ambulacrum ante aedes luculentum aspicimus, intramus latius, ac primo pedem intro in
  </p>
  <p>
   peristylium ferimus. In cujus summo fons erat, eo dynasta dignus: Bacchi simulacrum,
  </p>
  <p>
   factum e marmore, cado insidens, mejere videbatur in lacum sibi subjectum, eratque
  </p>
  <p>

   Tum pateat vesica illi, nec calculus obsit,
  </p>
  <p>
   Semper ut expulsa vina bibantur aqua.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius rogat unum ex familiaribus ut domino renunciet, se ejus vocatu accitum
  </p>
  <p>
   adesse; proinde imperet si quid velit. Respondet ille, omnes tunc ad eum aditus
  </p>
  <p>
   interclusos esse, nam psittacis, lusciniis, felibus, simiis, canibus, quos semper circa se
  </p>
  <p>
   habet quosque plus oculis suis diligit,24 coenam dabat, ac suis ipse manibus cibum
  </p>
  <p>
   praebebat. Cui Gallonius: “Fac, inquit, sciat me adesse; cetera nihil moror.” Interea dum
  </p>
  <p>
   ille it reditque, complura parietibus epitaphia, hinc et illinc affixa, conspicio. Rogo quid
  </p>
  <p>
   sibi velint. Respondet mihi unus: “Haec sunt epitaphia felium et canum defunctorum,
  </p>
  <p>
   quos dominus in deliciis habuit, quosque ipse multis cum lacrimis supremo mandavit
  </p>
  <p>
   officio. At ego in pugillaribus, quos semper mecum fero, coepi ea describere:
  </p>
  <p>
   EPITAPHIUM FELIS NOMINE NICOLOSAE
  </p>
  <p>
   Si quaeris, Nicolosa fui, non improba felis;
  </p>
  <p>
   Cui tulit immeritam sumpta lacerta necem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Molliter erubui moriens incumbere lecto,
  </p>
  <p>
   Languida vel duro fundere membra solo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pugnavique diu, morti non cedere nixa,
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed frustra; heu tandem perfida plus potuit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sic mihi perque domos perque ardua tecta vagari
  </p>
  <p>
   Semper, et aeternum vivere posse datur.
  </p>
  <p>
   At vos depictas squallentia terga lacertas,
  </p>
  <p>
   Lurida in apricis insequar umbra locis.
  </p>
  <p>
   EPITAPHIUM RUSPOLI CATELLI
  </p>
  <p>
   Ergo tibi invisae ruperunt stamina Parcae,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ruspole, amor domini deliciaeque tui.
  </p>
  <p>
   Non ita sydereos violavit Lesbia ocellos,
  </p>
  <p>
   Passeris extincti tristia fata gemens,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ut potuit lacrimis temerare cadentibus ora,
  </p>
  <p>
   Cum daret ille tuas munera ad inferias.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed valeant luctus. Nam te non caeca tulerunt
  </p>
  <p>
   Tartara, sed caeli lucida signa tenent,

   Ut, canis arenti depulso sidere, posthac
  </p>
  <p>
   Mitius aestates sub tua jura fluant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coeperam aliud alterius felis epitaphium describere, cum Gallonius accersitur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Accurrimus, scalas ascendimus, introducimur in eam diaetam, ubi vir ille princeps
  </p>
  <p>
   epulabatur, in lecto eburneos pedes habente ac purpura auroque constrato, obsessus
  </p>
  <p>
   undique felium et catellorum turba, quorum alius insistebat illi in humero, alius in collo,
  </p>
  <p>
   alius cibum petebat, alius uncipedibus25 bolum e manibus eripiebat;26 alius latrabat,
  </p>
  <p>
   alius placide accubans domini misericordias expectabat. At ille, ubi nos venisse
  </p>
  <p>
   animadvertit, Gallonium intuens: “Scin, inquit, quamobrem huc te accersiri jussi?” “Non
  </p>
  <p>
   equidem, inquit ille, sed imperiis tuis obsequens, huc me conjeci et expecto quid velis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Ego dicam tibi, inquit ille. Vidi hodie dum ociosus per urbem vector, in fenestra privatae
  </p>
  <p>
   domus ad Vestae27 ludere cercopithecos duos, quibus nihil dixerim me vidisse in vita
  </p>
  <p>
   venustius. Fac mihi eos dono, precario vel, si fieri aliter non potest, precio abducas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neque operi neque sumptui parcas. Nam ardeo cupiditate incredibili eos habendi.” “Scio
  </p>
  <p>
   quos dicas, inquit Gallonius. Mox imperium tuum exequar, et quamquam eorum
  </p>
  <p>
   dominus ita sit versutus et callidus, ut dolis capi difficulter possit, tamen quo tibi animum
  </p>
  <p>
   expleam, fingam, inveniam, comminiscar rationem qua os illi pulchre sit sublitum.”28
  </p>
  <p>
   “Magnifice, inquit Bibulus, polliceris. At pol benefacta me hortantur tua, ut remunerer te
  </p>
  <p>
   grato aliquo munere—sed multa non possum et pauca pudet dare.” “Credo, ait

  </p>
  <p>
   aliquid aliud, replicavit Gallonius, quod tibi mea ars efficere hoc possit amplius?” “Recte”
  </p>
  <p>
   ait.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itaque discedimus, ad ostium devenimus, atque ibi hominem squalidum, aegrum,
  </p>
  <p>
   inter manus delatum in gestatoria sella collocari videmus; quem ubi Gallonius aspexit,
  </p>
  <p>
   continuo: “Quid istuc, inquit, rei est? O mi Agrostes (id illi erat nomen), unde hic pallor in
  </p>
  <p>
   vultu? Unde haec in membris infirmitas?” “Quoniam miser febri quotidiana30 laboro et
  </p>
  <p>
   male metuo, nisi quis me Deus respiciat, ut ex hoc morbo convalescam, vel saltem ne
  </p>
  <p>
   multos menses eodem implicatus detinear.” “Aesculapium et Salutem, inquit Gallonius,
  </p>
  <p>
   ne quid sit hujus oro.31 Bono animo es; mox febris abscedet, ita supercilium salit.32 Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   unde tantus hic repente morbus invasit? Et quo nunc aeger defereris? Nonne quae tibi
  </p>
  <p>
   sunt opus, defert hic princeps, qui tanta caritate feras etiam bestias amplectitur?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Respondit ille: “Causam morbi sustinet perpetuus scribendi, vigilandi et hac illac
  </p>
  <p>
   concursandi labor, dum huic inservio. At nunc, quia per aegritudinem nulli eidem esse
  </p>
  <p>
   usui possum, in nosocomium proximo Aesculapii fano conjunctum deferor. Hem, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   redactus sum miser?” Dum sic queritur, ecce tibi in tempore advenit adolescens, Fossio

   Istud igitur immortalitate dignum ingenium, ista virtus, ista probitas iis auxiliis indigebit
  </p>
  <p>
   quibus inquinatissimi perditissimique homines saepe abundant? Ergo te viri illi
  </p>
  <p>
   principes, quos longa consuetudine usuque devinctos habes, ita foede ac turpiter
  </p>
  <p>
   deferunt? Sed, ut illi tantum in se dedecus attrahant, ego tamen meum erga virum
  </p>
  <p>
   optimum studium, operam, officium desiderari non patiar. Ite, agite, deferte eum in
  </p>
  <p>
   domum meam. Ego tecto recipiam, ego in meo cubiculo atque adeo in meo lectulo
  </p>
  <p>
   collocabo; ego exquisitos tota Urbe medicos cogam, neque quidquam patiar illi deesse
  </p>
  <p>
   quod ad levandam aegritudinem prosit.” His actis, pedes prosecutus est eum,
  </p>
  <p>
   gestatores identidem admonens ut pedetentim irent ac sedato nisu ne succussu morbus
  </p>
  <p>
   eidem efficeretur amplior.34
  </p>
  <p>
   Nos vero, quia id diei tempus erat, ad aedes Gallonii cum ipso contendimus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam paulo ante, ut ad se in hospitium diverteremus, impetraverat. Jamque aberamus
  </p>
  <p>
   ab his propius, cum ab Hermagora quodam, nuper inter dynastas adlecto, litterae eidem
  </p>
  <p>
   redduntur in haec verba:
  </p>
  <p>
   HERMAGORAS GALLONIO SALUTEM. Amplissimus dignitatis gradus, quem
  </p>
  <p>
   nuper ascendi, postulat, ut domum et familiam ita uxori meae mihique
  </p>
  <p>
   amplam et ornatam instituam, uti me dignum est, et persona quam gero.
  </p>
  <p>
   Verum, quia absum ab Urbe, cogor hanc illi provinciam demandare, cui
  </p>
  <p>
   maximam rerum mearum fidem habeam, cuique meam in primis
  </p>
  <p>
   existimationem caram fore arbitrer.35 Quamobrem peto a te, pro nostra
  </p>
  <p>
   amicitia, ut negocium suscipias, atque aedes mihi laxas magnificasque
  </p>
  <p>
   conducas; ac praesertim eum familiarium numerum cogas, qui meae
  </p>
  <p>
   dignitati conveniat. Quod autem ad genus hominum attinet, ut meam
  </p>
  <p>
   sententiam noris: cupio homines formosos, elegantes ac bene vestitos.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neque refert si sint impuri et inhonesti, dummodo sint apti. Atque etiam ea
  </p>
  <p>
   te cura libero ut ex doctis ac litteratis viris unum aut alterum seligas, qui fit
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi ab epistolis et a cognitionibus.36 Nam quidquid huic generi hominum

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   by civil servants who had the responsibility for official written communications; the former position was

  </p>
  <p>
   datur, disperit totum. Hodie enim quivis vel amanuensis vel leguleius recte
  </p>
  <p>
   satisfacere his muneribus potest. Illud in primis memineris, ut cocum mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   solum praeter alios quaeras, quique mortuis etiam coquere quod placeat
  </p>
  <p>
   possit. Atque in eo omnes industriae diligentiaeque tuae nervos
  </p>
  <p>
   contendas,37 velim. Da operam ut valeas.
  </p>
  <p>
   His litteris perlectis, Gallonius me intuens: “Qualis tibi, inquit, videtur haec
  </p>
  <p>
   indoles?” “Egregia sane, inquio, atque praeclara; neque boni quidquam est quod ab ea
  </p>
  <p>
   sperari non possit.” Sed dum magni illius viri sapientiam admiramur, qui in uno coco
  </p>
  <p>
   eodemque optimo tantum ponat esse ornamenti universae familiae,38 incautum me
  </p>
  <p>
   neque animadvertentem pene rheda oppressit. Sed nescio quis brachio prehensum in
  </p>
  <p>
   alteram partem abstraxit, periculoque surripuit. Sed ubi me ex timore collegi, quaero
  </p>
  <p>
   quisnam esset ille tam potens, qui rheda obvios obtereret. Tum Gallonius arridens:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Erras, inquit; non marem sed foeminam ea rheda circumvehit. Haec est Pasicompsa,
  </p>
  <p>
   Dynastae uxor, nobilis mulier ac nota; genere atque forma, praeterea libidine atque
  </p>
  <p>
   luxuria, similis Salustianae Semproniae. Nam a teneris, ut aiunt, unguiculis, lascivos
  </p>
  <p>
   amores ac vetitos honestis permissisque praeposuit; itaque eximium semper aliquem
  </p>
  <p>
   habuit, cui clam virum se tota permitteret. Nunc autem, viro orbata, genio multo magis
  </p>
  <p>
   indulget.39 Nam quantum illi aetas detrahit formae, tantundem libidinis addit. Et quia ob
  </p>
  <p>
   formam immutatam non facile in amorem invenit qui cum ipsa faciant mutuum, suis
  </p>
  <p>
   responsible for drafting petitions and directives, and the latter was responsible for collecting information

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   litteras misere scriptas, quibus ita demum ille rescripsit (nam apud me habeo earum

  <p>
   litterarum exemplum):

   Improba maturo cum sis jam proxima fato,

   Perlectis his litteris, usque adeo elata est ira, ut sine ulla dubitatione insanire omnibus
  </p>
  <p>
   ac furere videretur, minitari absenti Cleobulo, vociferari, lacrimas non tenere. Sed ille
  </p>
  <p>
   nihilo magis ejus lacrimis vel minis movetur quam si sit codex aut silex.”
  </p>
  <p>
   His dictis Gallonii aedes ingredimur, ibique omnibus in rebus liberaliter accepti
  </p>
  <p>
   divertimus, jucundi sermonis ansam, Pasicompsae ira luxuriaque praebente. Nam
  </p>
  <p>
   Paulus Aemilius: “Exprobratio, inquit, senectutis mulieri bilem in nasum impellit.45
  </p>
  <p>
   Muliere impura nihil contumacius. Quae semel pudicitiam et pudorem ab se dimisit,
  </p>
  <p>
   nunquam, pol, ne quadrigis quidem albis adipiscitur postea.46 Quo Ceres et Bacchus
  </p>
  <p>
   immigrarunt, inde pudicitia, dimissis manibus, evolat.47 Mulier libidine incensa mare est,
  </p>
  <p>
   quod nullis neque fluminibus neque rivis expletur. Aestus luxuriae, ut ignis, non
  </p>
  <p>
   suppeditandis, sed subtrahendis libidinis alimentis extinguitur. Mulierum insatiabilitas
  </p>
  <p>
   potest quidem admissarios plures ad languorem dare, non tamen modum sibi statuere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Si genere ac divitiis ferox libido desaeviat, nullis neque juris, neque legum, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   existimationis repagulis inhibeatur. Omnia sibi licere, nihil esse nefas existimat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sermones, objurgationes et monita sunt lapides impudicae, quae illi cerebrum excutiant,
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   possint, vincula rumpunt; qui amori obtemperant, graviores semper ipsi sibi compedes
  </p>
  <p>
   indunt. Pudicitiae cum deformitate corporis saepe convenit, cum forma foedus raro

   Liber II
  </p>
  <p>
   Et longa maris tempestate jactatos et itinere superioris diei fatigatos, tam arctus
  </p>
  <p>
   somnus excepit, ut non antea dissolverit, quam orta lux omnia compleret. Sed tandem
  </p>
  <p>
   expergefactos et cubile egressos, Gallonius invitat in hortos cujusdam Dynastae, qui, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   ille narrabat, ex summis vitae ac fortunae sordibus ad ingentes divitias pervenisset.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Nam accepi, inquit, detineri ibi aegrum adolescentem mihi carissimum; cupioque, nisi
  </p>
  <p>
   aliter vobis videatur, eum invisere. Sed non pigebit vos illuc venisse. Nulli enim sunt
  </p>
  <p>
   horti in his regionibus quos magis visendos dicatis.” Cumque nos non nolle
  </p>
  <p>
   dixissemus,48 secum una perreximus; atque inter eundum quaesivimus de Gallonio cur,
  </p>
  <p>
   si omnes Mauri atri essent, ibi fere omnes albi nascerentur? Qui respondit, primum,
  </p>
  <p>
   eam insulam longo intervallo a ceteris Mauris esse disjunctam; tum mulieres eas,
  </p>
  <p>
   postquam se cum Romanis miscuissent, patribus similes liberos genuisse. Inter haec
  </p>
  <p>
   atque alia duorum millium passuum viam emensi, ad hortos pervenimus; pulsamus
  </p>
  <p>
   ostium, aperitur, intramus, atque ubi ea pulchritudo recens ad oculos meos pervenit,49
  </p>
  <p>
   non horti nescio qui, sed coelum ipsum, atque adeo ipsa Jovis regia mihi patefieri visa
  </p>
  <p>
   est. Nam, foribus apertis, operis universi forma tota simul se obtulit et in conspectu

  </p>
  <p>
   objicit, ambulacris septa compluribus, praeclaris distincta fontibus, ac variis amoena
  </p>
  <p>
   floribus, praefert in summo theatrum, multis scalarum ordinibus nativo e marmore
  </p>
  <p>
   instructum atque compositum; et ex singulis scalis plures tum ebulientes, tum effluentes
  </p>
  <p>
   aquae, velut aspicientium turba ad fontem in media cavea positum spectare, et placido
  </p>
  <p>
   murmure tanquam faustis acclamationibus operi plaudere videntur. Hinc et illinc a
  </p>
  <p>
   theatro lapideis scalis in novum artis miraculum scanditur. Aequa et quadrata planicies
  </p>
  <p>
   complures dispositas in quincuncem arbores sustinet sepitque locum maceries regia
  </p>
  <p>
   lauro contecta. Platani incredibili proceritate principem in medio locum obtinent; infra
  </p>
  <p>
   earum fastigium humiliores multae ab utraque parte arbores subsunt, iis quidem
  </p>
  <p>
   proceritate dissimiles, sed dignitate ac praestantia simillimae, siquidem regiae lauri sunt
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes prope ad miraculum pulchrae. In medio, sub procerrimis illis platanis, mensa
  </p>
  <p>
   marmorea pedum fere sexaginta in longitudinem, et quindecim in latitudinem patens
  </p>
  <p>
   extenditur; quam a summo ad extremum, relicto hinc et illinc commodo ad coenandum

  <p>
   spacio, plures leniter erumpentes atque in se redeuntes aquae intersecant, gratum
  </p>
  <p>
   convivis liquorem et frigus praebentes. Nam voluptatem positus in conspectu fons affert,
  </p>
  <p>
   ipsi etiam arti admirabilis. Etenim Triton factus e lapide sedet eques in cancro,
  </p>
  <p>
   admotoque ad os cornu inflare sonum51 videtur; diceres eum audire, tantam artificii
  </p>
  <p>
   subtilitas fidem mendacio facit, nisi hunc ab auribus errorem quinque late manantes ex

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   emittunt, nec sine praemio filicis, musci, capilli Veneris aliaeque herbescentis viriditatis,
  </p>
  <p>
   quam circa ea subjectus elicit humor. Jam vero locus egregius, et in primis amoenus,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui non praetereuntis velocitatem, sed contemplantis tarditatem et moram desiderat,
  </p>
  <p>
   poscere videbatur, ut esset ubi moraturus hospes consistere ac deambulare tutus a
  </p>
  <p>
   solis injuria posset. Itaque ab utroque fontis latere columnae excitatae complures,
  </p>
  <p>
   porticus duas effingunt, quas, tecti loco, plures vitium propagines ita undique
  </p>
  <p>
   ambientibus ramis atque invicem complicatis integunt, ut vix in densam umbram
  </p>
  <p>
   penetrare solis radius possit. Nunquam oculi hac specie et pulchritudine capti
  </p>
  <p>
   satiarentur, nusquam aliquid melius ac perfectius quaererent, nisi duplex scalarum ordo,
  </p>
  <p>
   post fontem, quem dixi, in trianguli formam extructus, diu delectatos neque tamen
  </p>
  <p>
   satiatos, eo illos vocaret, ubi extremos artis conatus aspicerent. Primum cancelli scalis
  </p>
  <p>
   praefixi, praeclari ad aspectum et certis ex locis aquas ebulientes, fontem quem prae se
  </p>
  <p>
   habent ornant atque augent. Tum locus, in quem ascenditur, rebus magnis et
  </p>
  <p>
   admirabilibus plenus. Hic ars, sibi ipsi aemula, a se ipsa vincitur; hic Natura artis,
  </p>
  <p>
   aemulae suae, conatibus favet. Nam aquas, quibus illa res admirabiles praestat, majore
  </p>
  <p>
   vi copiaque suppeditat; hic nemora non temere nata, sed ordine posita, latiore campo
  </p>
  <p>
   excurrunt; hic avium caveae, columnis exaedificatae, nemora ipsa ambiunt et continent.
  </p>
  <p>
   In aditu vestibuloque speciosissimi hujus loci, declivi quodam solo catena jacet e lapide,
  </p>
  <p>
   89
  </p>
  <p>
   per quam aqua ad cancrum, de quo antea diximus, influit; tanto artificio, ut contortae
  </p>
  <p>
   convolutaeque in plures circulos aquae annulos assimulare; tanto strepitu, ut propter
  </p>
  <p>
   vim impetumque, quo defluunt, catenarum similem sonitum edere videantur. Haec
  </p>
  <p>
   autem catena, longiore tractu perducta demum ita cancri brachiis adnectitur, ut eum
  </p>
  <p>
   colligare constringereque ne commovere se possit existimes. Ingentes paulo supra eam
  </p>
  <p>
   catenam fornices e lignea materia facti, prosequentibus eos ederis ambitiosissimis,52
  </p>
  <p>
   attolluntur in regiae molis similitudinem; qui fornices inter aediculas quatuor fastigiatas
  </p>
  <p>
   amplam et augustam sine fastigio aedem includunt; cujus medium fons tenet,
  </p>
  <p>
   sepulcralibus monumentis non longe dissimilis, ab imo latus atque rotundus, angustus
  </p>
  <p>
   et acuminatus in summo, acumen efficiente aqua egrediente sursum e patera. Ut totum
  </p>
  <p>
   hoc opus ad regum maximorum delicias, non autem ad ejus libidines factum videatur,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui ceteris specimen esse jubetur.
  </p>
  <p>
   His igitur oculis53 diligenter a nobis perlustratis, villam ingredimur, amplam illam
  </p>
  <p>
   quidem et rebus omnibus instructam, sed quae nihil ad hortos. Ubi in amoeno lucidoque
  </p>
  <p>
   conclavi, serico sub conopeo, jacebat adolescens, magis corruptus deliciis, quam
  </p>
  <p>
   fatigatus aliquo morbo. Cui Gallonius: “Quid hoc, inquit, morbi est?” “Febris,” respondet.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Caruistine illa heri,” Gallonius repetit, “vel nudius tertius? Coenavistine?”54 Cum haec

  </p>
  <p>
   macerat, in me transferre non queo? Quid me fiat si quid humanitus tibi contingat?”57 Ille
  </p>
  <p>
   sane commotus: “Ne te crucia, inquit, ne mihi ad morbum hoc etiam!58 Aspectus tuus
  </p>
  <p>
   omnem vim morbi diripiet.” Et, quo flendi ac lamentandi pausam faceret, opiparum illi
  </p>
  <p>
   prandium parari ac dona plurima congeri jussit. Nos, mulieris pietatem admirati,
  </p>
  <p>
   magnum atque spectatum egregii cujusdam amoris exemplum inspexisse testamur; ac
  </p>
  <p>
   de eo, qui cubiculi fores tuebatur, exquirimus quid ea ad illum aegrum mulier attineat?
  </p>
  <p>
   Num soror, num uxor sit, num affinis vel cognata?59 Qui: “Nihil horum ea est, ait; sed
  </p>
  <p>
   meretrix60 est in primis subdola, blanda, fraudulenta, avara, Nanna nomine, quacum ille
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   amoris clavo fixus inhaeret, ut nullis amicorum neque admonitionibus, neque precibus
  </p>
  <p>
   extrahi queat; et nisi ad rationis terminos, unde longius abiit, se propere redigat,
  </p>
  <p>
   quantum intelligo, omnis ejus res brevi meretriciam in domum exulatum abibit. Et quo

  <p>
   quantum illi misero ardoris faciebat amor, tantum etiam algoris zelotypia conflabat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meretrix cata, quae illum hamum vorasse cognosceret, ut omnes faciunt, quae se amari
  </p>
  <p>
   intelligunt, nihil tam laborabat, quam ut miserum eum haberet, et in primis ut ad sese
  </p>
  <p>
   cum anima ejus habentiam averteret.61 Atque ad eam rem usa est hoc adolescente, cui
  </p>
  <p>
   servio; qui amore ipsius captus aliquot jam dies ejus aedes obambulabat, quemque
  </p>
  <p>
   pejus angue mercator horrebat. Nam est in primis scitulus, mundulus atque venustulus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coepit igitur illa adolescentis formam laudare, cincinnos efferre; ille miser uri et cultro,
  </p>
  <p>
   quem sub sago contexerat, minitari, si adolescenti obnoxia fieret. Ubi meretrix hominem
  </p>
  <p>
   umbraticum, magis timidam inter viros mulierculam, quam fortem inter mulieres virum,62
  </p>
  <p>
   cultrum habere animadvertit, haereditatem sibi obvenisse existimavit, ac ‘Croesum,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, divitiis supero, si eum in me cultrum ille semel educat.’ Itaque mittit adolescenti
  </p>
  <p>
   qui dicat, ut proxima concubia nocte63 domum ad se veniat, ac sine ullo metu januam
  </p>
  <p>
   feriat. Vesper adest; mercator, re bene gesta, domum meretricis venit, coenat,
  </p>
  <p>
   decumbit, cum ea litigat; queritur quod adolescentem plus sese diligat. Illa contra
  </p>
  <p>
   negare, sed frigide; interdum suspiciones injicere. Ille stomachari atque ira vehementius
  </p>
  <p>
   efferri; cum ecce tibi commodum adolescens ad januam adest; pulsat; ille, suspicione
  </p>
  <p>
   offensus et insidias metuens, e lecto se ejicit, ad fenestram advolat, et ‘Quis, inquit,

   61 This phrase is similar to Plaut. Truc. Prologue, line 21 as found in some early (pre-twentieth century)
  </p>
  <p>
   editions. Whereas the Harvard Loeb edition (Plautus and de Melo 2011-13) interpolates the line as
  </p>
  <p>
   “hiscum anima ad eum habenti erce teritur,” the critical apparatus in Plautus and Weise 1847 show that
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s reading is close to Lambinus (“ad se cum anima eius habentiam averrerit”).
  </p>
  <p>

   actutum.’66 Mercator, cognito adolescente,67 tum quidem omnem violentiam e pectore
  </p>
  <p>
   expromit atque: ‘Hinc abire ni properas,68 ait, ferere.’ Et magis quo se iratum ostenderet,
  </p>
  <p>
   quam damnum vel malum daturus, districto cultro in Nannam incurrit. At illa, tanquam
  </p>
  <p>
   praedivinans quid futurum esset, dum ille in fenestra foribus injuriam factam queritur,
  </p>
  <p>
   furtim e lecto desiluerat, ac rubrica in eum usum quaesita dexteram impleverat. Venit
  </p>
  <p>
   ergo ille amenti similis, clamans: ‘Itane pessima? Ante meos oculos amatorculum mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   tuum adducis?’ Unaque opera femur illi dexterum et brachium lato cultro percussit. Illico
  </p>
  <p>
   illa dolis insistens, admota ad os manu, rubrica illud infecit et simul: ‘Obsecro, populares
  </p>
  <p>
   vicini, vestram fidem;69 subvenite, ferte inopi auxilium; malus hic mihi faciem feriit. Quid
  </p>
  <p>
   agam? Quo me vertam? Audebone posthac ita deformis cuiquam in conspectum
  </p>
  <p>
   prodire?70 Non faciam, lethum mihi consciscam.’71 Hic etiam ab ancilla clamor extollitur,
  </p>
  <p>
   accurrunt vicini, januam effringunt, quaerunt quid sit? Clamor utrinque, undique
  </p>
  <p>
   concursus. Ille miser, qui sibi esset conscius, nullum a se vulnus inflictum mulieri, primo
  </p>

   66 actutum: immediately, instantly (frequently found in Plautus).
  </p>
  <p>
   67 The punctuation in both the 1637 and 1645 editions is confusing: a comma is placed after “actutum,” a
  </p>
  <p>
   period after “mercator,” and “cognito” is the beginning of the following sentence. Instead, I have placed a
  </p>
  <p>
   period after “actutum” and made “mercator” the first word of the following sentence, as I believe it makes
  </p>
  <p>
   the most sense in the context of the narrative.

   beneficio occultatus, in aedes cujusdam Dynastae tanquam in aram confugere. Ubi
  </p>
  <p>
   postea in ocio rem agitanti, non satis liquebat quomodo illud a se vulnus exisset. Et
  </p>
  <p>
   secum: ‘Ego, quod scio, latus illi et brachium, non etiam faciem verberavi, et quod rem
  </p>
  <p>
   continet,72 non caesim sed gladii planicie. Unde ergo vulnus habet? At simulat. At hisce

  <p>
   ego oculis vidi. Fit verisimile, nam non semper it manus quo ea dirigitur, quamvis sit ad
  </p>
  <p>
   feriendum certa. Tum ego iratus eram; ira caeca est, sensus adimit, mentem eripit. Quid
  </p>
  <p>
   igitur fiet?’ Dum in hac cogitatione curaque versatur et simul altercantibus libidinibus
  </p>
  <p>
   tremit ossa pavore,73 statuit per amicos interpretes eam sibi placare, hoc est, argento
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   qui quidem mulierem adeunt. At mala, quo doli procederent, unguentis sibi faciem

  <p>
   vicissitudines memorant;74 laudant eos qui simultates, occasione oblata, dimittunt. Non

  <p>
   est passa mulier eos pergere atque insequi longius, sed continuo exclamat: ‘Abite,

  <p>
   esse eam sibi ab ore infamiam, quam ipse imposuisset, eripere. Medicum esse

  <p>

  <p>
   meretrici ubi vulnus assimulabatur inusserat, quae alte ibidem inhaerendo sulcum
  </p>
  <p>
   cicatrici non absimilem fecerat. Hunc sulcum, praesente mercatore, ungebat

  <p>
   obligabatque diligentissime. Clam eo fide illa iterum obstringebat, sed quotidie

  <p>
   remissius, quo fiebat ut paulatim deleri videretur. Quid opus est verbis? Vix dies octo

  <p>

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   His peroratis, coeperat cubicularius ille alium ejus meretricis dolum exponere,
  </p>
  <p>
   sed dicere aggressum interpellavit Gallonius, qui exiens ab adolescente: “Heus vos,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, properandum est mihi in aedes Plusii, cui meas operas locavi; nam pene abiit
  </p>
  <p>
   hora qua ibi me adesse oportebat, ut officium illud cui sum conductus exequerer. Tum
  </p>
  <p>
   invitavit me ejus tonsor ad prandium rogavitque ut quos mihi commodum esset
  </p>
  <p>
   vocarem; nam duabus umbris81 fore locum aiebat. Itaque vos mecum adducam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Delectabit enim facetos horum urbanorum mores, praesertim in conviviis agitandis,
  </p>
  <p>
   agnoscere.” “Tui sumus, inquio, duc quo lubet.” Ne multa; in aedes magni illius viri
  </p>
  <p>
   venimus. Sciscitatur Gallonius quid rerum agat dominus, num jam evigilaverit, num
  </p>
  <p>
   surrexerit. Respondet unus: “Iam diu ille surrexit; nam simul ac, inquit, caelum illuxit, e
  </p>
  <p>
   lecto prosiluit ac, tonsore accersiri jusso, duas apud illum horas transmisit; atque
  </p>
  <p>
   rasitando, tergendo, pingendo,82 ita miserum illum defatigavit, ut eum ad languorem, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   potius ad interitum, dederit. Tonsore dimisso, in secretiore conclavi se cum sarcinatore
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusit; sumptoque in manus circino, suo more experiebatur num singula inter se
  </p>
  <p>
   puncta vestibus acu praefixa ex aequo distarent, num thorax vel sagus corpori

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   96
  </p>
  <p>
   eleganter haereret; atque in hoc studio alterae duae horae fuere consumptae. Nunc
  </p>
  <p>
   vero calcearium exercet, miserum habet; clamat corium, quo calcei constant, non esse
  </p>
  <p>
   molle atque flexibile, sed durum ac rigidum; praeterea calceos ipsos non esse habiles
  </p>
  <p>
   neque aptos ad pedes. Irascitur, vociferatur, se Diis suis iratis natum esse83 queritur, cui
  </p>
  <p>
   nihil ex sententia contingat. Sed mox, ut spero, calceolarius etiam ex hoc laqueo
  </p>
  <p>
   jugulum eximet. Nam Flamines vocari, tus et merum parari jussit, quibus rem divinam
  </p>
  <p>
   Iovi optimo maximo faciant; qua peracta, ut creditur, prandium inibit.” “Non malum est,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit Gallonius, ut in procoetonem84 me conferam, ibique ejus imperium expectem.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Nos igitur, a Gallonio introducti, unum ejus angulum petimus, et collo obstipo, quae
  </p>
  <p>
   dicebantur quaeque ibi fiebant, excipimus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ac primum orta est inter eos quaestio, quaenam pullis gallinaceis aestate, quae
  </p>
  <p>
   hyeme curatio, quod condimentum aptius esset. Nec minima erat inter eos contentio,
  </p>
  <p>
   nam aliud alii placebat. Tum ille, qui hos sermones lacessierat, contradicentibus ceteris,
  </p>
  <p>
   ficedulam85 turdo et coturnicem phasiano anteponebat; omnesque certatim illudebant
  </p>
  <p>
   unum ex eo numero qui nullum in his rebus sensum habere videbatur; ac sordidum eum
  </p>
  <p>
   et incultis moribus appellabant; imo ne hominum quidem numero esse dignum ajebant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ab hoc sermone ad carpendam lacerandamque mulierum famam digrediuntur, atque
  </p>
  <p>
   alias parum honeste pudicitiam habere, criminari; alias consciis maritis, prostituere
  </p>
  <p>
   formam ac vendere; alias, forma egregia filias, his atque illis non parva mercede
  </p>
  <p>
   subjicere; multaque his addere, ac nomen etiam uniuscujusque mulieris dicere, quae,

  <p>
   97
  </p>
  <p>
   quia nullam earum notitiam habebam, oblitus sum statim. Erat hominum cultus
  </p>
  <p>
   elegantissimus, sed parum virilis; neque fere ibi quisquam erat, qui novas nuptas
  </p>
  <p>
   elegantia munditiisque non vinceret. Illud vero ridiculum, quod, cum duo inter se de
  </p>
  <p>
   amicula rixari86 coepissent, eorum unus alterum, contumeliae scilicet causa, hircum
  </p>
  <p>
   olidum, impurum, perfidiosum, obscoenum appellavit. Ille, quo se lacessitus
  </p>
  <p>
   ulcisceretur, novas eidem contumelias studebat ingerere; sed cum maxime quaereret,
  </p>
  <p>
   nullum acrius maledictum invenire potuit, quam ut illi objiceret quod incultus, inornatus
  </p>
  <p>
   ac male tonsus incederet. Quod cum vehementer admirati essemus, audivimus postea,
  </p>
  <p>
   nullum apud eos haberi flagitium majus, quam tibialia, ligaminibus sericis ad terram
  </p>
  <p>
   usque productis, non adstringere, vel minimam in collari rugam admittere; nullum nefas
  </p>
  <p>
   grandius existimari quam perpeti, ut in coma vel barba pilus unus ceteris altior
  </p>
  <p>
   excrescat, nec statim novacula revocare quod petulantius sese profuderit; nihil magis
  </p>
  <p>
   sordidum censeri, quam mensem integrum eodem uti amictu.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed improvisus Plusii adventus omnem illis iram sedavit, et in tranquillo
  </p>
  <p>
   constituit. Nam, qui velum allevabat, festive: “Heus vos, inquit, manus de tabula!
  </p>
  <p>
   Magister adest.”87 At ille, qui praeeuntibus ceteris, per88 procoetonem transiens ad aram
  </p>
  <p>
   Iovis se confert, sacrificanti adest, revertitur, prandium poscit; Gallonius, ut omnibus
  </p>
  <p>
   rebus instructum sit prandium, curat. Quo expleto, revertitur ad nos atque: “Is, inquit, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   me invitavit ad prandium, jussit sterni lectos in hortis urbi propinquis, ad fontem large
  </p>
  <p>
   manantem. At me hercle capietis voluptatem ex loci aspectu; nam et propter arborum

  </p>
  <p>
   multa, eo deducimur, locum intramus. Ubi tantam aquarum vim cernimus, quantam
  </p>
  <p>
   uspiam nos non vidisse meminimus. Etenim non certis fontibus, sed imbribus, non rivis,
  </p>
  <p>
   sed fluminibus locus totus exundat. Specus sex, incertum natura vel ars in montis dorso
  </p>
  <p>
   cavavit; sed ita ut unis tribus alteri tres incumbant; asperis ac rudibus tophis lepide et
  </p>
  <p>
   jucunde perhorridi. Ab his tophis tum intra tum extra specus haerentibus, ac varia
  </p>
  <p>
   herbarum viriditate diffusis, aquarum imbres magni vehementesque procurrunt, qui tum
  </p>
  <p>
   specus ipsos implent, tum latum ante specus ipsos lacum efficiunt. Locum parietes, ab
  </p>
  <p>
   utroque montis latere producti, in latitudinem quadrante; per quos horridulos,89 et ipsos
  </p>
  <p>
   saxis intectos, quo incultae illi specuum asperitati respondeant, perpetui defluunt
  </p>
  <p>
   imbres; habentque post se inter diffusa late nemora speciosissima ambulacra. Hic talis
  </p>
  <p>
   est sonitus, qualem ex multis atque alte cadentibus aquis esse oporteat; talis species,
  </p>
  <p>
   quam fontes, nemora, ars denique et natura ipsa componant. In hoc tam amoeno ac
  </p>
  <p>
   perfrigido loco, apud eum fontem speciosissimum, statutos lectos et appositam
  </p>
  <p>
   mensam invenimus, ea epularum varietate constructam, qua extrui solet ab iis qui
  </p>
  <p>
   amicos magnifice volunt accipere. Ecce autem, ex improviso, ingens ad aures nostros
  </p>
  <p>
   clamor ac strepitus accidit. Qui prandium dabat, convivas alios a se vocatos adesse
  </p>
  <p>
   narrabat. Capita hominum numeravimus novem, attamen ex strepitu, quo in eum locum
  </p>
  <p>
   irruperant, sexcentos esse jurasses. Hi simul ut apparuerunt, tanquam hostes capta
  </p>
  <p>
   urbe solent, cuncta diripere, tuburcinari, vorare, oenophora exhaurire et clamore omnia
  </p>
  <p>
   miscere. Ille qui invitaverat, pene irasci, clamare ut manus lavarent, ut lectis se

  <p>
   89 The 1637 and 1645 editions read “horriduli” but Mark T. Riley suggests this textual emendation to

  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   commendarent; atque aegre impetratum est ut vellent accumbere. Tres erant lecti et in
  </p>
  <p>
   singulis quaterni discumbimus: summus Gallonius, ac prope eum ego, tum Paulus
  </p>
  <p>
   Aemilius, infra ceteri omnes. Hic tantum vini exhaustum est quantum una vindemia
  </p>
  <p>
   colligitur. Qui stellas numerare potest, numerum etiam cyathorum inibit qui sunt
  </p>
  <p>
   exhausti. Atque ab implendis tradendisque poculis viri sunt quinque defessi. Sed inter
  </p>
  <p>
   clamores maximos, inter risus effusissimos saepe ructus, saepius crepitus erumpebant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nulla alia vox exaudiebatur, nisi haec: “Bene mihi, bene vobis, bene Plusio nostro.” Jam
  </p>
  <p>
   non in ventres, sed in cloacas, sed in barathra profundi vinum videbatur.90 Vix lauti
  </p>
  <p>
   quidquam in mensa apponebatur, cum direptum illud vidisses. Erat inter eos unus longe
  </p>
  <p>
   urbanissimus, qui cantharum, in quo potitabat, frustis esculentis tanquam rosis
  </p>
  <p>
   coronabat et, cum vinum implesset,91 in se totum ingurgitabat. Hic clamores edi, hic
  </p>
  <p>
   cachinnos tolli et faustis acclamationibus operi gloriosissimo plaudi. Productum erat
  </p>
  <p>
   prope ad vesperam convivium, nec bibendi modus ullus nec satietas erat. Ecce autem
  </p>
  <p>
   adest a Plusio servus, qui Gallonio nunciat, ut, relictis rebus omnibus, curriculo92 ad
  </p>
  <p>
   Praetorem transeat, eique Plusii93 verbis exponat, ut honoris ipsius gratia Toxillum e
  </p>
  <p>
   reis eximat, et quamprimum incolumem ad sese remittat. Hic evictus,94 quod
  </p>
  <p>
   hereditatem Veneri relictam95 expilasset, quod falsos testes subornasset, ac multa alia

   nefaria fecisset contra jus fasque, contrusus in carcerem fuerat. Itaque a reliquis
  </p>
  <p>
   conviviis distrahimur, atque ad tribunal Praetoris accedimus. Hic magnae cuidam
  </p>
  <p>
   quaestioni operam dabat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lictores mulierculam forma non mala, quam meretricem esse ajebant, in jus
  </p>
  <p>
   abstraxerant, ejusque opera male se fustibus acceptos querebantur, ac, fidei faciendae
  </p>
  <p>
   causa, brachia ac tergora plagis varia ostentabant. Rogat Praetor, cui tantum animi ad
  </p>
  <p>
   audaciam96 fuerit, ut unius meretricis causa publicas personas tam insigni affecisset
  </p>
  <p>
   injuria? Respondet unus, ceteris fortasse ad dicendum paratior: “Furem manifesto
  </p>
  <p>
   deprehensum rapiebamus in carcerem, qui, dum illac transimus, ubi venefica isthaec
  </p>
  <p>
   inhabitat, sese e vinculis eximit, manus nostras effugit, atque in unam ejus vici domum
  </p>
  <p>
   irrumpit. Nos insequi, nec cum satis constaret quo se recepisset, singulas ejus viciniae
  </p>
  <p>
   domos perquirere. Ne multa; ad aedes hujus meretricis venimus, fores pultamus; nemo
  </p>
  <p>
   respondet, calcibus impetimus; tantundem effringimus, nihilo magis. Ergo scalas
  </p>
  <p>
   ascendimus, ac mulierem in lecto jacentem invenimus. Tum ego: ‘Quid est, inquam,
  </p>
  <p>
   quod taces? Cur es passa fores effringi? Eratne ita magnum recludere?’ Illa in eodem
  </p>
  <p>
   silentio perseverare. Tum ego: ‘Vide, inquam, obstinatum ad tacendum animum, ut sese
  </p>
  <p>
   offirmat? Propudium, jam aliquam ex te vocem saltem ingratiis eliciam’; iratusque virgis
  </p>
  <p>
   graviter illi latus impello. Tum demum illa, dolore coacta: ‘Heus!’ exclamat. Rem
  </p>
  <p>
   incredibilem; vix ‘Heus’ dixerat, cum imbris vel grandinis more crebros nobis in
  </p>
  <p>
   scapulas, in caput, in brachia fustium ictus sensisses irruere, neque tamen fustes,
  </p>
  <p>
   neque aliquis qui verberaret conspiciebatur. Nos metu perterriti ac male multati, terga
  </p>
  <p>
   vertere, per scalas praecipites currere, pedibus salutem quaerere.” Interrogat Praetor

   quemadmodum id factum esse arbitrentur. Respondent illi fidenter, se existimare id sibi

  <p>
   contigisse muliebribus veneficiis atque cantionibus97 ac: “Tibi, inquiunt,98 nosse licet ab
  </p>

  <p>
   diobolare,99 pagoque polluctum.100 Ac praetorem intuens: “Si mihi, inquit, fides publica

   detur, rem omnem uti sese habeat aperiam.” Iussa mulier a praetore, quae sciret,

   recepisset ac propterea amorem et dona alio transtulisset. Orabat, rogabat ut sibi

   unde id factum existimet. Respondet illa, se existimare, deorum Manium104 opera fuisse
  </p>
  <p>
   perfectum. Tum: “Tu igitur, inquit praetor, venefica es?” Mulier subdola atque ad
  </p>
  <p>
   malitiam instructa105: “Nihil, inquit, minus; quin misere sum veneficiis aliarum obnoxia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam prope est annus, cum a Lemuribus exagitor, maleficae cujusdam invidia. Ac saepe
  </p>
  <p>
   est, cum verberibus ad necem affecta, pro mortua inter vicinarum manus efferor.” His
  </p>
  <p>
   auditis, praetor vicinis in hanc rem testimonium denunciari jubet. Qui statim adeunt, sed
  </p>
  <p>
   vicinitatis necessitudine, et ut a muliere gratiam inirent, eamque periculo damnationis
  </p>
  <p>
   eriperent, jurati illud idem pro testimonio dicunt quod meretrix in defendendo
  </p>
  <p>
   responderat. Tum praetor a severitate in misericordiam versus, mulierem velut
  </p>
  <p>
   lymphatam seu ceritam de consilii sententia absolvit, de reis eximit,106 lictores abire in
  </p>
  <p>
   malam rem jubet. Consilio dimisso, praetor ex aula, ubi cognitioni operam dabat, se
  </p>
  <p>
   subducit et in cubiculum abdit. Non enim apud eos, ita uti Romae mos est, judicia
  </p>
  <p>
   publica exercentur in foro, sed in aedibus magistratuum fiunt. Gallonius, ut introducatur
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   illum, quem falsi et expilatae haereditatis criminibus107 accusatum habebat in carcere,
  </p>
  <p>
   sententiis judicum absolvendum curet. Hoc enim beneficio magnam se a Plusio gratiam
  </p>
  <p>
   initurum. Respondet Praetor reum illum esse scelerum caput,108 crimen manifestum,
  </p>
  <p>
   capitale, invidiosum et: “Si juri legibusque sit locus, jam pridem, inquit, in supplicium, in
  </p>
  <p>
   crucem abreptum eum oportuit. Sed quoniam Plusio ita ille est cordi, rationem inveniam

  <p>
   made a criminal offense (crimen) until an enactment of Marcus Aurelius (161-180 CE), more than 100
  </p>
  <p>
   years after the fictional events of this novel. Punishment for this offense was not generally carried out,
  </p>
  <p>
   and the act often led to the lawful acquisition of the stolen property by the offender through the law of
  </p>
  <p>
   “usucapio pro herede” (Berger 1953). For the explication of the law see Dig. 47.19.0.

  <p>
   veneris, sed cras coena dabitur.’ ‘Quid hoc est?’ ait ille, ‘nonne promisisti in hunc diem?’

   sistas mihi interpunxi, quia illa altera ad coenandum sunt initium novae orationis atque

  <p>
   Iam sol oceano laetus emerserat ac terras exhilaverat, toto coelo luce diffusa,
  </p>
  <p>
   cum nunciatur Gallonio juvenes stare ad januam duos quosdam, qui eum magnopere
  </p>
  <p>
   evocarent. Prodiit ille et nos una secum. Rogat quid velint. At illi: “Currendum est tibi,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquiunt, in aedes Democriti, amicissimi tui, curandumque aut consolando, aut consilio,
  </p>
  <p>
   aut re, ut eam illi aegritudinem adimas, quae misere eum arripuit. Nam neque coenavit
  </p>
  <p>
   heri vesperi, nec proxima superiore nocte potuit partem aliquam quietis accipere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rogatus quid aegre sibi sit, non audet dicere; tantum suspirat, illacrimat. Tu fortasse,
  </p>
  <p>
   pro amicitia quae inter vos est, poteris ex eo tantae aegritudinis causas exculpere.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Quibus Gallonius: “Nunciate, inquit, Democrito, nos ibi mox adfuturos.” Sed placuit
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonio medicum arcessere et secum ad aegrotum adducere. Itaque venimus in aedes
  </p>
  <p>
   cujusdam Aristarchi, qui, ut Gallonius narrabat, magnum in medicis nomen habebat
  </p>
  <p>
   atque eum oppressimus contemplantem in speculo formam suam. Ac simul ut
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonium aspexit: “Quid tibi,” ait, “haec figura oris videtur?” “Pape, inquit, nimis lepida,
  </p>
  <p>
   nimisque nitida.” “Quid corpus hoc? Vide ut est solidum, leve, succi plenum; ecquae est
  </p>
  <p>
   mulier digna ad hanc formam?” “Nulla, inquit Gallonius, sed missa isthaec face, et
  </p>
  <p>
   causam, quae nos huc impulit, accipe. Venimus, ut te ad aegrotum adducamus, ex
  </p>
  <p>
   107
  </p>
  <p>
   animi aegritudine pene confectum, atque illum ut sanum facias.” “Perfacile istuc quidem
  </p>
  <p>
   est,” repondet Aristarchus, “sed non est mihi ocium in praesentia; nam promisi operas
  </p>
  <p>
   meas flamini magno Liberi patris, qui jam diu laborat stomachi vitio.” Cui Gallonius: “Si
  </p>
  <p>
   est ita, inquit, ut dicis, in publica commoda peccem,122 si tibi molestus sim. Vale.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Postquam discessimus, quaerimus ex Gallonio num sanus sit necne, qui ad curandum
  </p>
  <p>
   insanum, eum adducendum curet, cujus caput Anticyris tribus sanari vix possit?123
  </p>
  <p>
   Arrisit Gallonius ac: “Stultitia, inquit, in qua iste versatur, sane ridicula est atque faceta.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam cum sit forma adeo, ut vidistis, enormi et inhonesta, ut monstrum potius hominis

  <p>
   incredibili, acerbo.” Rogat num magnum aliquod facinus patrasset, unde judicium
  </p>
  <p>
   poenamque metueret? Negat. Quaerit num aes alienum tam grande conflasset quod
  </p>
  <p>
   dissolvi non posset? Negat id quoque. Instat, num pro altero spopondisset, num

   “Cedo, inquit Gallonius, quid est, quod te ita miserum habet?” “Illud, ait, quod mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   senectutem instare jam sentio et, quod est consequens, mortem esse in propinquo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Haec cura tam alte mihi in animo insedit, ut extrahi nequeat. Ita eum acriter urget ut

  <p>
   sedari non possit.” Tum Gallonius exclamat: “Abi hinc, quo dignus es,126 cum ista tua

  <p>

  <p>
   se ad vesperam esse victurum?” “Ut libet, inquit ille; quin, si me audiet, jam veniet atque

   Primum hoc expedi: utrum mortem in rebus bonis an in malis ducis? Si in bonis, quid

   metuis? Si in malis, quid eandem finem malorum facis? Non potest ea res numerari in

  <p>
   fortunarum; et, quoniam tibi insaniendum erat, aliquod saltem stultitiae genus

  <p>
   contigisset laetum, festivum, exhilaratum. Ita enim et tibi laetitiam quaereres et nobis
  </p>
  <p>
   ludos parares, non autem utrisque molestiam, ut nunc facis, afferres.” Tum ille: “Derides
  </p>
  <p>
   me?, inquit. Quid? Tu solus ita es sapiens, ut omni stultitia propemodum careas? Erras:

  <p>
   nulla est sapientia tam magna, quae omni prorsus administratione stultitiae vacet.” Cui

   addas.” “Quoniam, inquit Gallonius, tibi molesti intervenimus, geremus morem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Abibimus, at moneo ne me posthac accersiri jubeas; nam frustra jusseris, ac, si miseriis
  </p>
  <p>
   delectaris, deos oro ut perpetuo sis miser.” Nec plura locutus, se foras ejecit atque ad
  </p>
  <p>
   demonstranda nobis praecipua urbis loca convertit, aedes videlicet sacras, theatra,
  </p>
  <p>
   porticus, fora, gymnasia, domus privatas. Quarum una, ampla sane atque magnifica, in
  </p>
  <p>
   fronte grandibus notis incisa, praeferebat haec verba:
  </p>
  <p>
   Dominus domus iis, quorum operam sibi conducit, praeter mercedem
  </p>
  <p>
   neque beneficium, neque gratiam, neque pecuniam largitur. Hoc illis esse
  </p>
  <p>
   praedictum vult, ne postea se fuisse deceptos querantur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum ego: “Laudo, inquam, liberum et apertum ingenium hominis, qui neminem
  </p>
  <p>
   vana spe captum patitur apud se operam perdere.” At: “Tum magis id dicas, inquit
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius, si scias quemadmodum servet in eo, quod promiserit, fidem. Sed quamquam
  </p>
  <p>
   totum se prodat, ut vides, attamen, si emanet in vulgus desiderari aliquem in ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   familia, incredibile memoratu est quam multi etiam locupletes ac domi nobiles eum
  </p>
  <p>
   locum quaesitum adveniant. Adeo Dynastarum nomen hic sanctum habetur, ut sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   quisque honestum putet, sine ulla spe sese illis in servitutem dicare. Verum, quem in
  </p>
  <p>
   hanc domum, sive voluntas sive casus impellit, huic omnes putant et fortunam atque
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes res bonas esse adversas.” Haec dicentem luctus et clamor ingens interpellavit;
  </p>
  <p>
   conversi videmus scrutarium in Foro Cupidinis scruta popello vendentem132:
  </p>
  <p>
   Qui miser horrisonis implebat questibus auras,
  </p>
  <p>
   Dilacerans saeva pectora nuda manu;
  </p>
  <p>
   Filius, et tristi flebant cum fratre sorores;
  </p>
  <p>
   Latrabat tumida maxima voce canis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ipse videbatur Brennus crudeliter ignem
  </p>
  <p>
   Romulidum133 tectis supposuisse ferox;
  </p>
  <p>
   Vel Danaum Dolopumve dolis consternere ferro
  </p>
  <p>
   132 Hor. Epist. I.VII.64-5: “Volteium mane Philippus / vilia vendentem tunicato scruta popello / occupat.”
  </p>
  <p>
   133 Romulidae: descendents of Romulus, i.e., the Romans.
  </p>
  <p>
   111
  </p>
  <p>
   Pergama,134 et antiquas Laomedontis135 opes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum commota nimis vicinia tota reclamat;
  </p>
  <p>
   Currit, ut afflicto sedula praestat opem:
  </p>
  <p>
   Atque, “Ubi sunt fures? Ubi, pessima turba, latrones,
  </p>
  <p>
   Inquit, quique tuam diripuere domum?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Quid misero inveniunt tantos conflasse tumultus?
  </p>
  <p>
   Quadrantem, furax quem puer abstulerat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neque aderat uxor in turba lugentium. Nam eam domi inclusam contineri ajebant cum
  </p>
  <p>
   institore nescio quo, quem, conscio marito, ipsa sibi custodem corporis sui et socium
  </p>
  <p>
   adjunxerat; idque propter nescio quam timiditatem et inanes quosdam metus, a quibus
  </p>
  <p>
   verebatur ne, dum maritus in foro mercenariis vinclis136 constrictus erat, corriperetur;
  </p>
  <p>
   quamobrem nihil magis quam solitudinem horrebat. At institor, scrutarii vocibus
  </p>
  <p>
   excitatus, sane commotus est atque, aegre a mulieris latere avulsus, accurrit in forum,
  </p>
  <p>
   ut contubernali suo, quemadmodum uxorem, ita facultates atque animam tueretur. Venit
  </p>
  <p>
   igitur, in turbam se inserit, causam tumultus exquirit; reperit quadrantem furto sublatum
  </p>
  <p>
   totam illam turbam conflasse. Quamobrem, magna cura liberatus, detractam sibi e
  </p>
  <p>
   crumena drachmam scrutario tradit, qui laetus pro quadrante subrogatam sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   drachmam fuisse, ad intermissa negocia se recipit. Ille ad mulieris meticulosae
  </p>
  <p>
   custodiam regreditur. Erat ex adverso adolescens filius familias, mulieris ejusdem
  </p>
  <p>
   amore deperditus, sed patris parsimonia et lex quinavicenaria,137 ut nihil esset quod
  </p>
  <p>
   daretur, id curaverant probe. Restabat nihil aliud nisi oculos pascere, sectari, in templa
  </p>
  <p>
   Deorum ducere et reducere. Neque tam erat ipsi molestum carere muliere, quam

  </p>
  <p>
   137 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 5) refers to Plaut. Pseud. I.iii.303-4: “Perii! Annorum lex me perdit
  </p>
  <p>
   quinavicenaria. / Metuont credere omnes.”

  </p>
  <p>
   acerbum alterum ea potiri; et, si daretur optio, vel totam optasset aetatem sine illa
  </p>
  <p>
   vivere, quam pati eandem unum diem esse cum altero. Quocirca, ab amore ac zelotypia
  </p>
  <p>
   simul oppugnatus, rivalem suum apud scrutarium his verbis in suspicionem adulterii
  </p>
  <p>
   conabatur adducere, odio suo pietatis praeferens speciem:
  </p>
  <p>
   Quae nova simplicitas haec est ridendave, conjux,
  </p>
  <p>
   Uxori moechum conciliare tuae?138
  </p>
  <p>
   Nonne externa tuo cernis vestigia lecto,
  </p>
  <p>
   Cum reducem vesper te facit esse domi?
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoc ait et rumor. Non sentis murmura, et omnes
  </p>
  <p>
   Conversos oculos in tua probra vides?
  </p>
  <p>
   Quis tam stultus adest, vel tam sine pectore amator,
  </p>
  <p>
   Tempora qui frustra commoda abire sinat?
  </p>
  <p>
   Dum properat Cretem ventis dare vela secundis
  </p>
  <p>
   Conjux, Tyndaridem Troicus hospes habet.139
  </p>
  <p>
   Si facit egregia uxoris te forma timere,
  </p>
  <p>
   Illam crede mihi; sic, bone, tutus eris.
  </p>
  <p>
   In longas poteris quamvis proficiscier oras,140
  </p>
  <p>
   Iam non insidias sit timuisse141 tibi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ante meum potius caput hac cervice recedet,142
  </p>
  <p>
   Quam violet thalami foedera casta tui.
  </p>
  <p>
   Non pudet excubias me cara ad limina semper
  </p>
  <p>
   Ducere, non rixas inseruisse piget143;
  </p>
  <p>
   Aspera non Hyemis incommoda ferre recuso,
  </p>
  <p>
   Non fessum nuda ponere corpus humo;
  </p>
  <p>
   Seu gelidus rapidis aquilonibus intonet aether,
  </p>
  <p>
   Seu subitus multa decidat imber aqua.
  </p>
  <p>
   138 The 1637 and 1645 editions read “uxori . . . suae” but the corrigenda at the end of the 1645 edition
  </p>
  <p>
   replaces “suae” with “tuae,” which I have followed.
  </p>
  <p>
   139 IJsewijn’s note here (Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 6) reads “Cf. de Menealo Creten petente, et Helena:
  </p>
  <p>
   Posthomerica Cypria.” In l. 9-12 of this poem I hear echoes of Ov. Her. XVII.159-63 (from Helen to Paris):
  </p>
  <p>
   “resque domusque / et tibi sit curae Troicus hospes, ait. / vix tenui risum, quem dum conpescere luctor, /
  </p>
  <p>
   nil illi potui dicere praeter erit. / vela quidem Creten ventis dedit ille secundis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   140 proficiscier = infinitive
  </p>
  <p>
   141 timuisse has an aorist rather than a past infinitive force; cf. Tib. I.II.28: “insidias non timuisse decet.”
  </p>
  <p>
   142 Ov. Pont. II.VIII.65-7: “nam caput e nostra citius cervice recedet, / et patiar fossis lumen abire genis, /
  </p>
  <p>
   quam caream raptis, o publica numina, vobis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   143 Tib I.I.73-74: “nunc levis est tractanda venus, dum frangere postes / non pudet et rixas inseruisse
  </p>
  <p>
   iuvat.”
  </p>
  <p>
   113
  </p>
  <p>
   Ipse aderit lateri custos mihi bellicus ensis,144
  </p>
  <p>
   Nec fiet longo cura labore minor;
  </p>
  <p>
   Quaque feret gressus, sequar hanc, seu templa Deorum
  </p>
  <p>
   Visere, seu dicet velle redire domum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Non est passus scrutarius plura eum loqui, sed: “Una, inquit, opera duorum labori
  </p>
  <p>
   parcam: tui dicendi, mei auscultandi. Tua isthaec magnifica verba atque promissa non
  </p>
  <p>
   pluris facio quam plumas avium papposque volantes. Etenim ne uno quidem nummo
  </p>
  <p>
   ditiorem mihi crumenam efficiunt. Nihil mihi opus est eo, qui uxori meae latus ab
  </p>
  <p>
   externis viris muniat; nam istorum defensorum abunde est domi. Sed opus est eo, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   pecuniam et commeatum defensoribus afferat. Atque, ut tu noris, ille quem tu mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   invisum facere properas, cum domum meam venit, non solus ingreditur sed commeant
  </p>
  <p>
   cum eo vel pecuniae sacculi, vel tritici acervi, vel carnaria, vel casei, vel utres olivi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itaque, dum mihi sic usui est, illi maneat potius; tu aliam quam tuearis, exquire. Nam
  </p>
  <p>
   istiusmodi custodes tui similes nihil moror.” Atque eodem tempore quo adolescenti
  </p>
  <p>
   illuderet, terga obvertit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum Gallonius: “Censeo, inquit, domum eamus. Nam est in animo vos a prandio
  </p>
  <p>
   viri cujusdam nobilis domum adducere, quo quintodecimo quoque die eruditi complures,
  </p>
  <p>
   tum exercendi, tum declarandi ingenii causa conveniunt. Verum quod ad virum istum
  </p>
  <p>
   nobilem attinet, nolite existimare quidquam ipso perfectius existere vel in corporis vel in
  </p>
  <p>
   animi dotibus. Nam puer, omnium aetatis suae multo formosissimus,145 doctorum
  </p>
  <p>
   hominum familiaritates expetiit, adeptas constantissime tenuit; et usque adeo eorum
  </p>
  <p>
   exercitationibus deditus est, ut unum ex illis corpus, nomine Academiae nuncupatum,
  </p>
  <p>
   144 bellicus ensis: drawn (i.e., battle-ready) sword; cf Ov. Met. III.534.
  </p>
  <p>
   145 Similar to the description of Alcibiades in Nep. Milt. VII.1: “Natus in amplissima civitate summo genere,
  </p>
  <p>
   omnium aetatis suae multo formosissimus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   114
  </p>
  <p>
   cogendum constituendumque curaverit. Et quia nullum potest corpus sine capite
  </p>
  <p>
   coalere, praefectus est illi unus, qui tamquam membris caput inhaereat; atque hodie ex
  </p>
  <p>
   vetere eorum instituto convenire frequentissimi debent in ejus aedes. Ubi etiam binos
  </p>
  <p>
   ejus liberos videbitis aetate, ingenio ac forma praestantes, sed magis sapientia ac
  </p>
  <p>
   probitate conspicuos. Non enim eos parens ad hunc morem, qui nunc increbuit, sed ad
  </p>
  <p>
   veterem disciplinam optimam sanctissimamque instituit. Quo fit, ut nullis iidem vitiis
  </p>
  <p>
   affines inveniantur quae secum fert adolescentia, sed omnis in eis eximia ac digna
  </p>
  <p>
   homine nobili doctrina laudetur, qui a gravioribus exercitationibus tanquam ab opere
  </p>
  <p>
   feriati,146 non tradunt se languori ac voluptatibus, sed in haec amoenissima studia,
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam in hortos, et ad hanc animi remissionem liberalissimam conferunt. Quo die hic
  </p>
  <p>
   litteratorum conventus convocatur, eorum unus, qui eas sibi partes accepit, cathedram
  </p>
  <p>
   ascendit, ac ceteris academicis paulo infra sedentibus vel solutam orationem, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   carmen, vel ejusmodi aliquid dignum eruditis auribus profert. Transactis jam ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   partibus, princeps Academiae a singulis Academicis vel odas, vel epigrammata
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam collectam a convivis exigit,147 qui clara voce quidquid nuper ingenio
  </p>
  <p>
   pepererunt, exponunt. Vos igitur his studiis elegantissimis deditos illuc adducam, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   aditus omnibus patet. Sed interea domi meae sedete tantisper, dum redeam
  </p>
  <p>
   expectantes. Nam promere quae opus sunt debeo Dynastae meo, ut sit paratum
  </p>
  <p>
   prandium; tum nos etiam de reliquiis prandebimus.” Ille it, redit. Sed in redeundo
  </p>
  <p>
   quidam ipsi notus occurrit et lateri adhaesit neque, cum domum jam pervenisset, potuit
  </p>
  <p>
   eum a se divellere, sed pertinaciter haerens: “Prandebo, inquit, apud te hodie.”
  </p>
  <p>
   146 Cic. De or. III.XV.58: “sic illi a negotiis publicis tamquam ab opere aut temporibus exclusi aut voluntate
  </p>
  <p>
   sua feriati.”
  </p>
  <p>
   147 Cic. De or. II. LVII.233: “quoniam conlectam a conviva, Crasse, exigis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   115
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius dissimulans: “Derides me, ait, ac ludis ludo tuo148; dispeream si sim
  </p>
  <p>
   obsonatus ex tuis meritis.” Ille: “Nihil agis, inquit; vocata res est149; hic sim hodie
  </p>
  <p>
   oportet.” Ac eadem opera pallium posuit, et gladium quo erat succinctus et soleas exuit,
  </p>
  <p>
   et accubitum ivit. Gallonius, ut contendere durum est cum victore,150 manus dat, cedit
  </p>
  <p>
   atque: “Ut lubet, inquit, sed ita familiariter accipiere, ut te huc venisse poeniteat.” Ac, ne
  </p>
  <p>
   eum videretur invitus recepisse, frontem exprompsit et ad hilaritatem animum dedit. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   videre erat151 illius inhonestatem et aviditatem cibi, quemadmodum unumquodque,
  </p>
  <p>
   quod erat bellissimum raperet, in os mitteret, voraret, ut se vino impleret. Postquam
  </p>
  <p>
   pransus et appotus est probe, deducit pedes de lecto, soleas induit, pallium et gladium
  </p>
  <p>
   repetit, ac lateri humeroque componit, salutatoque Gallonio discessit. Eo egresso, variis
  </p>
  <p>
   sermonibus pomeridianum illud tempus fefellimus. Sed ego, admiratus hominis
  </p>
  <p>
   impudentiam ac voracitatem, me continere non potui, quin quaererem de Gallonio quid
  </p>
  <p>
   illic hominis esset, qui tanta vi expugnatum152 aliena prandia veniret. Qui ait: “Ex hoc
  </p>
  <p>
   eodem est oppido, eidemque Dynastae, cui ego, operas suas locavit. Sed ejusmodi
  </p>
  <p>
   homines, qui versantur in aulis, si ex facie atque ex ornatu corporis aestimes, tibi

  <p>
   148 Plaut. Pseud. I.i.24: “Ludis iam ludo tuo?”
  </p>
  <p>
   149 The Plautine phrases “vocata res” (e.g., Curc. IV.iv.563) and “vocata opera” (e.g., Stich. 3.2.472) have
  </p>
  <p>
   been corrected in modern editions to “locata res” and “locata opera” (see Plautus and de Melo 2011-13).
  </p>
  <p>
   Earlier editions have “vocata” in both of these phrases (see Plautus and Weise 1847).
  </p>
  <p>
   150 Hor. Sat. I.IX.42-3: “ego, ut contendere durum / cum victore, sequor.” Rossi’s use of Horace’s satire is
  </p>
  <p>
   appropriate here because it has a similar theme of trying to shake off an annoying hanger-on.
  </p>
  <p>
   151 = impersonal use of the verb sum, which carries the meaning “to seem”
  </p>
  <p>
   152 = supine form

  </p>
  <p>
   videbuntur esse quantivis precii; si ex censu,153 cassa nuce inaniores invenies.154 Ego
  </p>
  <p>
   magis misericordia quam aliqua vi adductus, hoc a me prandium extorqueri sum
  </p>
  <p>
   passus; nam fortasse misero nihil erat domi quod esset. Sed quoniam satis quievimus,
  </p>
  <p>
   abeamus, censeo, quo nos ituros constituimus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Ac brevi anfractu in illius viri nobilis domum pervenimus. Erat enim sita in ea
  </p>
  <p>
   urbis parte, quae colitur et habitatur frequentissime, quaque certis horis ultro citroque
  </p>
  <p>
   commeare animi causa omnis fere nobilitas solet. In aedium fronte, domini earum
  </p>
  <p>
   nomen grandibus litteris erat incisum: LVCIVS MINVCIVS SINISTER. Adeuntibus fons in
  </p>
  <p>
   medio viridarii elegantissimi positus objiciebatur. Pegasus, factus e marmore, Phoebo
  </p>
  <p>
   Musisque circundatus, pede terram feriens, magnam vim aquarum in altum excitabat. In
  </p>
  <p>
   cujus basi legebatur hoc epigramma in honorem domini ab Arido academico factum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hic, ubi dulce sonat cygnorum cantibus aether,
  </p>
  <p>
   Atque Helicona novum Lucius instituit,
  </p>
  <p>
   Conspicuum late fontem salientibus undis
  </p>
  <p>
   Durus Pegasei suscitat unguis equi;
  </p>
  <p>
   Ut sit ubi dominum tollatis in aethera, Musae,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et testudinea, Phoebe superbe, lyra,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quilibet insolito premeretur pondere, vestrae,
  </p>
  <p>
   Phoebe et Pierides, hoc erat artis opus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Postquam ea amoenitate ac pulchritudine satis oculos pavimus, venimus in
  </p>
  <p>
   aulam tabulis pictis undique ornatam ac refertam, in quibus primum tutelaris Academiae
  </p>
  <p>
   deus colebatur. Tum in altera tabula multis Virgo voluminibus insidens conspiciebatur,
  </p>
  <p>
   in cujus dextera tuba haerebat, simiaeque demortuae duae jacebant ad pedes. In
  </p>
  <p>
   virgine, Academia referebatur; in simiis autem extinctis, academiae itidem duae
  </p>
  <p>
   153 Cic. QRosc. XIV.42: “Quem tu si ex censu spectas, eques Romanus est, si ex vita, homo clarissimus
  </p>
  <p>
   est.”
  </p>
  <p>
   154 Hor. Sat. II.V.36: “eripiet quivis oculos citius mihi quam te / contemptum cassa nuce pauperet.”
  </p>
  <p>
   117
  </p>
  <p>
   significabantur, quae ad aemulationem illius infelicibus ortae auspiciis brevi perierant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ab utraque parte duorum illustrium Academicorum imagines ad vivum expressae155
  </p>
  <p>
   pendebant, quorum alter, Bellino nomine, insignem eclogam edidit, quae hodie ab
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus legitur; alter vero, Thalassicus appellatus, multa optimorum versuum volumina
  </p>
  <p>
   scripsit et in his fabulam Adonidis egregio poëmate cecinit. Erant autem omnes hae
  </p>
  <p>
   tabulae inaurata corona vestitae. Supra suggestum, Academicis dicturis extructum, ad
  </p>
  <p>
   quod duplici scalarum ordine ascenditur, insigne Academiae, Arpinatis pictoris
  </p>
  <p>
   nobilissimi manu depictum, inhaeret. Reliquos parietes singulorum Academicorum
  </p>
  <p>
   insignia vestiunt atque ornant. Sunt autem insignia apud eos similitudines quaedam,
  </p>
  <p>
   quibus unusquisque utilitatem, quam ex academicis exercitationibus percipit, addito
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquo brevi dicto, exponere atque oculis pene ipsis subjicere conatur. At erant ita apta,
  </p>
  <p>
   ita venusta, ut eorum cognitione nequaquam animum satiare atque oculos explere
  </p>
  <p>
   possemus. Sed quia audiendi gratia concursus fiebant, veriti ne, dum ociose
  </p>
  <p>
   spectamus, sedilia complerentur, sessum ivimus. Ubi oculos in se nostros macilentus
  </p>
  <p>
   quidam ac natu grandis attraxit, qui hac atque illac concursans, hunc rogabat ut
  </p>
  <p>
   accederet, illi in aurem loquebatur, alium ducebat sessum, alii obviam ibat, neque ullam
  </p>
  <p>
   partem quietis accipiebat. Quaero quisnam sit ille adeo negociosus, adeo irrequietus,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui nusquam consistat. Respondet Gallonius illum esse Salvium Tifernatem quendam,
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucii Minucii contubernalem, cujus solicitudini, diligentiaeque Academiae universae
  </p>
  <p>
   pondus incumbat: uno verbo eum esse Academiae τὰ πάντα; ejusque in primis studium

  </p>
  <p>
   negocia curat, sua negligit, prope ad egestatem redactus est. Sed constans est omnium
  </p>
  <p>
   opinio, hanc hodie Academiam stare opera ac diligentia quam praestat. Ille enim crebro
  </p>
  <p>
   academici uniuscujusque domum salutandi gratia venire, ille eos in hunc locum ducere,
  </p>
  <p>
   domum reducere; ille solus perficere, ut huic coetui litteratorum numerus neque
  </p>
  <p>
   frequentia desideretur. Haec Gallonio fabulante, ex improviso Salvius adest ac cuidam,
  </p>
  <p>
   fusca facie nigroque capillo, Cumino nomine, qui tabellas quas habebat in manibus,
  </p>
  <p>
   attente legebat: “Quid tibi, inquit, videtur haec oratio, qua Obtusus noster Nihil
  </p>
  <p>
   laudavit?” “Elegans, inquit ille, atque venusta. Sed venisse hoc illi in mentem gaudeo,
  </p>
  <p>
   praesertim mea caussa. Nam antea ferebam moleste, quod nihili homo haberer, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   propterea dabam operam sedulo ut aliquid essem. Nunc vero cum tantum in eo, quid157
  </p>
  <p>
   nihil sit, ponatur esse soliditatis et ornamentorum, jam mei non me poenitet, imo plane
  </p>
  <p>
   nihil esse delectat. Verum si Obtuso daretur optio eligendi utrum vellet, nescio an mallet
  </p>
  <p>
   esse nihil quam Caesar. Sed obsecro, cedo mihi stylum. Nam volo in his ipsis tabellis,
  </p>
  <p>
   in ima cera158 aliquot versiculis hanc illi sententiam exponere.”
  </p>
  <p>
   CUMINUS OBTUSO SALUTEM
  </p>
  <p>
   Ingemui quondam, traxique per ora ruborem,
  </p>
  <p>
   Cum me forte aliquis dixerat esse nihil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nunc, Obtuse, Nihil cum sic tua pagina laudet,
  </p>
  <p>
   Nec doleo, nec me dispudet esse nihil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed peream, si, cum vel Caesar vel nihil esse
  </p>
  <p>
   Possis, malueris funditus esse nihil.
  </p>
  <p>
   156 Cic. Cael. VI.13: “in illo homine mirabilia fuerunt, comprehendere multos amicitia, tueri obsequio, cum
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus communicare.”
  </p>
  <p>
   157 The 1645 edition changes this to “quod.”
  </p>
  <p>
   158 cera: used metonymically to mean a writing tablet covered with wax; “prima, secunda, ima (etc.) cera”

  </p>
  <p>
   His scriptis, tradidit tabellas Salvio, quas ille solita sua festinatione Obtuso deferendas
  </p>
  <p>
   reddendasque curavit. Nos vero magna cupido incesserat uniuscujusque cognoscendi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itaque voluimus scire quid hic Cuminus hominis esset. Atque responsum est eum esse
  </p>
  <p>
   virum Graecis et Latinis litteris doctum, atque ita Graece loqui, ut nullam nosse aliam
  </p>
  <p>
   linguam videretur. Atque eramus plura de eo audituri, nisi effusissimi quidam risus editi
  </p>
  <p>
   ab iis, qui nobis assidebant, curiositatem nostram alio avocassent. At ii philosophi
  </p>
  <p>
   cujusdam ex eo numero ingenium et acumen irridebant, qui invenisset densa omnia ac
  </p>
  <p>
   solida corpora esse perlucida, idque hac ratione conaretur ostendere: Manum suam
  </p>
  <p>
   dexteram hinc et illinc supra laevam agebat tanta celeritate, ut breve illud tempus, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   dextera excurrens laevam obtegeret, aciem effugeret ac propterea laeva semper cerni
  </p>
  <p>
   videretur. At ille, sive hoc dissimulans, sive non animadvertens, rationem concludebat
  </p>
  <p>
   hoc modo: “Nonne mea haec dextera est corpus densum ac solidum? At sic impulsa et
  </p>
  <p>
   agitata saepius laevam contegit, neque tamen oculis eripit. Sunt igitur omnia solida ac
  </p>
  <p>
   densa perspicua.” Non intelligebat dexterae agitationem oculis, ut dicebamus, illudere;
  </p>
  <p>
   quae si supra laevam immobilis staret, ita eam obduceret, ut cerni non posset. Docebat
  </p>
  <p>
   praeterea, terram esse fluidam, atque in ea animantia omnia velut pisces moveri. “Quid
  </p>
  <p>
   enim aliud, ajebat, sunt illa corpuscula, quae per solis radios aquarum more decurrunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   nisi terrae particulae? Sola igitur terra haec inferiora occupat, quaeque moventur omnia
  </p>
  <p>
   complectitur.” Verum non audiemus haec ab eo, qui mox dicturus est. Nam semper
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquid affert ingenio perfectum atque elaboratum industria, ac praesertim judicio
  </p>
  <p>
   limatum. Hic est ille Hiero Volusius in primis doctus, humani ac divini juris peritus,
  </p>
  <p>
   Graecis et Latinis litteris, denique omni eruditionis genere excultus; qui plura et egregia
  </p>
  <p>
   volumina, tum soluta oratione tum versibus edidit; neque quamvis egregius ad honores
  </p>
  <p>
   120
  </p>
  <p>
   ascendit, id quod saepe in hac Republica optimo cuique contingit. Haec atque alia de
  </p>
  <p>
   illo audiebamus, cum interim ipse comparet in cathedra. Erat facie honesta, sed macie
  </p>
  <p>
   ac pallore ex studiorum labore nonnihil obducta et, quia oculis minus utebatur,
  </p>
  <p>
   oculariorum159 praesidio munita, quae illi res auctoritatem magis quam deformitatem
  </p>
  <p>
   addebat. Coepit igitur culicem laudare, ea eruditione et eloquentia, sententiis adeo
  </p>
  <p>
   concinnis, adeo venustis160 ut omnium consensu sit judicatum, nihil ex eo loco auditum
  </p>
  <p>
   esse magis absolutum magisque perfectum. Qui postquam peroravit, descendit ac
  </p>
  <p>
   sessum inter alios abiit. At Princeps Academiae (qui erat adolescens rufus, genere
  </p>
  <p>
   summo, ingenio maximo, quique cursum suum transcucurrerat161; nam qua aetate alii
  </p>
  <p>
   de ineundo studiorum curriculo cogitant, ipse eorum metam attigerat), hic igitur
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescens tam nobilis coepit sigillatim unumquemque rogare ut, si quid novi carminis
  </p>
  <p>
   haberent, in medium afferrent. Ac primus omnium rogatur Plusius Accipiter. Hic capillo
  </p>
  <p>
   erat albo, sed ingenio et comitate neutiquam senex.162 Nam dicebatur esse cavillator
  </p>
  <p>
   facetus,163 hilaris, jucundus, comis et amico amicus,164 ac poëta in primis suavis,
  </p>
  <p>
   argutus ac lepidus. Hic, inquam, clara et suavi voce recitavit hoc hexastichum, quod ad
  </p>
  <p>
   virginem scripserat, cui melimela muneri miserat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Purpureis conspersa notis melimela rubemus,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et distenta gravi levia melle sumus.
  </p>
  <p>
   At simul exiguo perfuncta senescimus aevo;
  </p>
  <p>
   159 ocularia: spectacles, eyeglasses.
  </p>
  <p>
   160 Cic., Brut. XCV.325: “Genera autem Asiaticae dictionis duo sunt, unum sententiosum et argutum,
  </p>
  <p>
   sententiis non tam gravibus et severis quam concinnis et venustis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   161 Cic. Brut. LXXXI.282: “ita gravissumo suo casu, dum Cyri et Alexandri similis esse voluit, qui suum
  </p>
  <p>
   cursum transcurrerant, et L. Crassi et multorum Crassorum inventus est dissimillimus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   162 Plaut. Mil. III.i.631: “Si albicapillus hic, videtur neutiquam ab ingenio senex.”
  </p>
  <p>
   163 Plaut. Mil. III.i.642: “vel cavillator facetus vel conviva commodus / item ero.”
  </p>
  <p>
   164 Plaut. Mil. III.i.660: “nec qui amicus amico sit magis.”
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   It rubor a nobis foedaque ruga venit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sic crispanda manes, venient tibi fata senectae,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et tibi pulchra genis purpura, virgo, cadet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Et quia mos est illius academiae repetere quae dicuntur, ut, si quid primo intellectum est
  </p>
  <p>
   minus, iterum prolatum rectius percipiatur, ideo satis mihi fuit ocii ad excipiendum ea
  </p>
  <p>
   quae dicebantur. Secundo loco jussus est dicere Nicobulus Aridus, qui Claudium
  </p>
  <p>
   Magium mortuum, magna apud eos homines fama ac nomine, quique olim Academiam
  </p>
  <p>
   illam princeps rexerat, laudavit hoc carmine in quo acute, ut mihi videtur, allusit ad
  </p>
  <p>
   insigne Academiae, quod fons erat eximius, in cujus humore perlucido complures cygni
  </p>
  <p>
   natabant. Et, quia coeperat ita submisse ab initio dicere, ut vix a proximis audiretur,
  </p>
  <p>
   Plusius, sua solita festivitate: “Dic, inquit, Nicobule, clarius, ut qui in ultima aula sedent,
  </p>
  <p>
   exaudiant.” Qui obtemperans ait:
  </p>
  <p>
   Navigat Elysium placido dum Magius amne,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et fugit evictos nobilis umbra rogos,165
  </p>
  <p>
   Turba frequens passim viridantibus abdita silvis
  </p>
  <p>
   Prosilit, et totis emicat alta jugis:
  </p>
  <p>
   Nescia sed, quali properaret navita mundo,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quaeritat, unde novum cymba referret onus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ast ubi Bellinum veteri dare plura sodali
  </p>
  <p>
   Oscula, et amplexu nectere colla videt,
  </p>
  <p>
   Fontibus ex istis tantum fluxisse decorem
  </p>
  <p>
   Comperit, atque illis enituisse locis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Protinus ingeminat plausus, festisque choreis
  </p>
  <p>
   Mista refert blandis talia dicta modis:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Scilicet ille humor si tales educat umbras,
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoc erit aetherea clarius arce nemus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Nicobulo tacente, Fabullus Leonatus, sponte sua nec expectato Principis jussu: “Hoc,
  </p>
  <p>
   ait, epigramma Nicobuli revocavit mihi in memoriam odam, qua ego ejus quem meminit
  </p>
  <p>
   Bellini, poëtae clarissimi, mortem deflevi. Hanc ego, nisi aliter vobis videatur, exponam.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Ut lubet, inquit Princeps, quidquid enim attuleris, proderit.” Qui:
  </p>
  <p>
   165 Prop. IV.VII.1-2: “Sunt aliquid Manes: letum non omnia finit, / luridaque evictos effugit umbra rogos.”
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Quantus heu terris abiit relictis
  </p>
  <p>
   Splendor! heu quanto fremit aura luctu!
  </p>
  <p>
   Occidit Bellinus, amor, voluptas,
  </p>
  <p>
   Curaque Phoebi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aetheris vastas penetravit oras,
  </p>
  <p>
   Sicut et velox petit ignis alta,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et recurvatum celeris sagitta
  </p>
  <p>
   Praeterit arcum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stridet ut nervum fugiente telo
  </p>
  <p>
   Fulminis ritu laceratus aër,
  </p>
  <p>
   Morte Bellini repetentis astra
  </p>
  <p>
   Sic gemit Orbis.

  </p>
  <p>
   quod verebatur tot hominum eruditorum judicia subire, rogatus ut aliquid diceret
  </p>
  <p>
   recusabat. Sed tandem, ab amicis exoratus: “Aliquot, inquit, versiculos proferam, quos
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi superioribus diebus, cum essem ruri, sum passus excidere. Excitabat enim me et
  </p>

   inerat ad poësin189 quique, stans pede in uno, centum posset versus effundere.190 Hic:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Nescio, inquit, utrum sit optabilius ingenio an divitiis praestare, praesertim in his

  <p>
   moribus et in hac civitate, ubi divitibus solis praemia, voluptates, honores et gaudia

   Janus erat quidam in eo numero, cognomento Thorio, quique in eo conventu Offuscatus

  <p>
   primae dabantur. Et quamvis summam doctrinae et eruditionis laudem paucis

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   193 I have translated “sale . . . facetiisque” as “wit and humor”; in the context of satire sal is most famously
  </p>
  <p>
   found in Horace, e.g., Sat. I.X.2-4 which recalls the satirist Lucilius, who “sale multo urbem defricuit”

  <p>
   (“thoroughly doused the city with salt”).

   tandem, appellatus a Principe: “Deplorabo, inquit, hoc carmine adversam Caesaris

  <p>
   amici mei fortunam; cui annos nato duos supra triginta in sulcis rugosi illius menti nullus

   Sex Caesar lustris binos adjunxerat annos,

   Hic simul omnes cachinnos extollere, ac eodem tempore Latini sermonis puritatem
  </p>
  <p>
   elegantiamque, quam illud epigramma praeferebat, efferre. Erat ibi forte quaesitor
  </p>
  <p>
   Euganeus quidam, summa auctoritate ac senectute, cujus in aedibus Gallonii scripta
  </p>
  <p>
   quaedam aspexeram. Quae ita mihi placuerant ut non facile quidquam me vidisse
  </p>
  <p>
   faterer quod magis incorruptam illam Virgiliani saeculi scribendi rationem conservaret.
  </p>
  <p>
   De quo palam omnes loquebantur, debuisse illum jam pridem ad summum dignitatis
  </p>
  <p>
   fastigium ascendere, si esset locus probitati ac bonis artibus. Itaque vehementer aures
  </p>
  <p>
   arrexeram. Cupiebam enim eas voce illa erudita et digna Romanis auribus oblectare.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed ea spe prorsus excidi. Nam ea aetate et auctoritate praeditum virum omnes in
  </p>
  <p>
   parentis loco habent; ac bene et praeclare secum agi existimant, si interdum ad
  </p>
  <p>
   academicas illas exercitationes et in illum eruditorum conventum non gravetur
  </p>
  <p>
   accedere. Sed lenivit desiderium nostrum adolescens nobilis, Tyrrhenus nomine; cujus
  </p>
  <p>
   majores, religiosissimi mortales iidemque locupletissimi, quippe qui modio ac trimodio
  </p>
  <p>
   129
  </p>
  <p>
   nummos metiti essent;194 sacella elegantissima aedesque magnificentissimas195 in ea
  </p>
  <p>
   urbe excitaverant. Hic praestantissimum ingenium suum contulerat ad summam juris
  </p>
  <p>
   civilis scientiam, et jurisconsulto doctissimo se in disciplinam tradiderat; cujus artibus et
  </p>
  <p>
   exercitationibus ita deditus est, ut tamen, cum est ocium, praesertim rebus prolatis,196
  </p>
  <p>
   versus componat ea sermonis puritate elegantiaque praeditos ut admirationem faciant,
  </p>
  <p>
   eo urbanitatis colore conspersos ut Romanis etiam hominibus possint imponere, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   persuadere se idem cum ipsis natale solum habere. Rogatus igitur ut diceret, recitavit
  </p>
  <p>
   hoc epigramma de Cupidine et Apolline sub quercu dormiente:
  </p>
  <p>
   Dum somnus placidis Phoebum circumvolat alis,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et tegit umbriferis quercus opaca comis,
  </p>
  <p>
   Vicina properans vidit de rupe Cupido,
  </p>
  <p>
   Qui jussit celeres segnius ire pedes;
  </p>
  <p>
   Ac, “Solem video, dixit, recubare sub umbra,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quaeque diem retegunt lumina, nocte premi.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Erant in eo eruditorum numero quidam immisti, a quibus nullum pensum exigebatur,
  </p>
  <p>
   sed praeteribantur immunes. Cujus rei causam exquirentibus nobis, respondit unus illos
  </p>
  <p>
   esse ex vetere Academia neque ullis legibus ad recitandum obstringi. Sed cum
  </p>
  <p>
   pergeremus interrogare, quo ex genere hominum vetus Academia constaret: “Ex
  </p>
  <p>
   optimo, inquit, genere ac festivissimo. Ut enim ceterae res, ita etiam haec Academia, a
  </p>
  <p>
   parvis initiis orta, ad hanc amplitudinem quam videtis excrevit. Etenim ab initio aliquot

   194 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 14) refers to Plaut. Men. Prologue l. 14-15: “Vobis demensum dabo /
  </p>
  <p>
   Non modio neque trimodio, verum ipso horreo.” See also Hor. Sat. I.I.95: “dives / ut metiretur nummos”
  </p>
  <p>
   (“metitus” is a post-Classical form of “mensus”).
  </p>
  <p>
   195 Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 15 reads: “Refertur ad Augustinum Chisium, qui villam Chisianam, nunc
  </p>
  <p>
   Farnesinam aedificavit necnon Sacellum Chisianum in Ecclesiam S. Mariae de Populo, anno 1513 a
  </p>
  <p>
   Raphaele inchoatum.”
  </p>
  <p>
   196 rebus prolatis: lit. “when matters are put off.” For Cicero this means a period when court is not in
  </p>
  <p>
   session (see Cic. Mur. 28), which is a likely meaning given the context of Tyrrhenus’s law study; however,
  </p>
  <p>
   it can simply mean “on vacation” as in Plaut. Capt. I.i.78-9, 82, and 85.

   tantum adolescentes coïere in hanc domum per Dionysia ut comoediis agendis requiem
  </p>
  <p>
   ac voluptatem exquirerent. Et sunt isti qui taciti inter alios sedent. Neque mos iste
  </p>
  <p>
   exolevit, sed viget nunc etiam. Nec ad has comoedias, ut leges eorum sunt, quisquam
  </p>
  <p>
   nisi suffragiis admittitur, et si uno puncto minus tulerit, quamvis sit Dynasta, quamvis
  </p>
  <p>
   Rex ipse, repellitur ac rejicitur. Nuptis tantum nobilibus earumque viris simul liber ad eas
  </p>
  <p>
   aditus patet. Non enim putant indecorum ac turpe foeminis primariis aetate ac forma
  </p>
  <p>
   praestantibus risum movere.” Erat in hoc numero quidam honesta facie, capillo candido
  </p>
  <p>
   ac veste ad talos demissa, Ibero nomine, qui cum de more praeteriretur, surrexit ac:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Nolim, inquit, videri in comoediis tantum agendis satisfacere; cupio etiam in versibus
  </p>
  <p>
   faciendis probari vobis industriam meam atque ostendam hoc epigrammate rationem
  </p>
  <p>
   tuendae per aestatem valetudinis.” Erecti sunt omnium animi ad audiendum. Qui sic
  </p>
  <p>
   infit:
  </p>
  <p>
   Aestate ut valeas tota, nec saeva Leonis
  </p>
  <p>
   Vesani197 possit stella nocere tibi,
  </p>
  <p>
   Os nigro semper madeat gelidoque Lyaeo,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et jaceant sicco cetera membra loco.
  </p>
  <p>
   Risus est commotus et simul amoenum hominis ingenium cunctorum approbatione
  </p>
  <p>
   laudatum. De hoc audiebamus, esse neminem in illo nobilissimo actorum grege, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   militem gloriosum198 ad veritatem propius exprimeret. Hunc propter ejus suavitatem ab
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus diligi; hunc in conventibus amicorum, in conviviis, in compotationibus
  </p>
  <p>
   principem esse. Restabat Micrus a Pisauro, qui fere semper postremus rogabatur. Huic

  <p>
   Praeterea erat illi scribendi genus magnificum, enucleatum, dulce; sententiae
  </p>
  <p>
   splendidae et acutae. Hic cum paratus ad dicendum venisset, noluit in quorundam
  </p>
  <p>
   ineptiis haerere, qui cum multo ipsi malint dicere quam alii audire, recusando
  </p>
  <p>
   excusandoque diem consumunt, sed libera ingenuaque fiducia sic ait:
  </p>
  <p>
   Dum pius Aeneas flammis torretur Amoris,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quas bibit ex oculis, dulcis Elisa, tuis,
  </p>
  <p>
   “Mene, ait, incolumem misere incendia Trojae,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ut Carthago novis ureret alta rogis?
  </p>
  <p>
   Heu dispar morior! Potuit tunc addere famam
  </p>
  <p>
   Mors mihi; nunc misero vita decusque perit.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Cogitabam aliud etiam carmen vobis recitare, quo Philippi copiarum nostrarum
  </p>
  <p>
   Praefecti conjugem nuper extinctam, loquentem induco. Verum satietati aurium
  </p>
  <p>
   vestrarum potius occurrendum quam aliis eas versibus onerandas censeo. Quamobrem
  </p>
  <p>
   in praesentia supersedebo, illudque in aliud dicendi tempus rejiciam.” Sed omnes se
  </p>
  <p>
   statim velle audire dixerunt. Qui, solita alacritate, sic inquit:
  </p>
  <p>
   Ut mea perpetuum celebretur fama per aevum,
  </p>
  <p>
   Spargitur hic lacrymis carminibusque lapis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sunt haec grata quidem cineri pia munera nostro199;
  </p>
  <p>
   Attamen illa magis gloria summa placet,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quod tibi conjugio fuerim sociata, Philippe,
  </p>
  <p>
   Luminibusque ipsis carior atque anima.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoc mihi longa dabit securae tempora vitae;
  </p>
  <p>
   Unus eris titulis firma columna meis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Versibus indigeant aliae; mihi laudis abunde est,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quod tali dicor nupta fuisse viro.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silentium, quo fuit exceptum hoc carmen, et cunctorum approbatio non mediocriter
  </p>
  <p>
   placuisse illud ostendit. Sed cum jam nemo videretur superesse qui diceret, discedendi
  </p>
  <p>
   causa omnes surrexerunt. At Hiero Volusius, qui ita copiose culicem laudaverat, manu

  <p>
   silentium indixit ac: “Nolim, inquit, videri venisse asymbolus200 in hunc locum, vel potius
  </p>
  <p>
   in hoc litterarium quasi convivium, ubi a tot litteratis viris tanquam a convivis collectae

   Iambum quo Ursati, virtutis et honoris antistitis nuper extincti, immaturam mortem

  <p>
   Praeceps in improbum nefas semper ruit

  </p>
  <p>
   Nec dicta justis praemia
  </p>
  <p>
   Ad fulgidum Virtutis excitant decus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sic recta, quae sunt, odimus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quae laus tibi, decusque quantum saeculis,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ursate, restat omnibus,

  <p>
   Quem nec virens aetatis ac florens decor,

  <p>
   Nec purpurae clarus nitor,
  </p>
  <p>
   Virtutis arcta perculit de semita,
  </p>
  <p>
   Traxitque segne in ocium?
  </p>

   Haec cum dixisset, conclamatum est201 ilicet. Itaque, facta potestate abeundi,
  </p>
  <p>
   consurgimus; relictaque academicorum corona, quae obviam Hieroni processerat,
  </p>
  <p>
   eidemque doctissimam illam culicis laudationem gratulabatur, una cum reliqua turba

  <p>
   aspicimus, qui nudis pedibus atque oculis humi defixis, bini incedebant, ac nescio quod
  </p>
  <p>
   carmen flebili voce atque demissa canebant. Hos magnus itidem puellarum numerus
  </p>
  <p>
   consequebatur, ad eundem fere modum concinentium. Quod sane admirantibus nobis,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit Gallonius: “Alexander, Daphnes et Apollinis praeses ac Dynasta clarissimus,
  </p>
  <p>
   sextum jam diem decumbit in lecto, gravi periculosoque morbo implicitus. Atque, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   audivi, dum vos attentius dicta Academicorum excipitis, paucis abhinc horis morbus illi
  </p>
  <p>
   amplior est factus, ita ut medici prope desperent. At hi pueri puellaeque, quae ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   misericordia sustentantur, ad omnia Deorum pulvinaria202 Aesculapium orant, ut fit
  </p>
  <p>
   propitius. Et sane magnum haec civitas damnum immaturo ejus interitu faciet, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   nemo est qui sumptu ac magnificentia longius prodeat.” His dictis, quia non multum ad
  </p>
  <p>
   solis occasum temporis supererat, pedetentim ac placide domum regredimur. Ubi nos
  </p>
  <p>
   primo coenae, tum lecto tradidimus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed circa secundam noctis vigiliam203 expergiscimur, querulis lamentantium
  </p>
  <p>
   vocibus excitati, quae totam viciniam impleverant. Quamobrem exterriti consurgimus,
  </p>
  <p>
   capita ex fenestra proferimus, easque lamentationes ex nosocomio Gallonii aedibus
  </p>
  <p>
   proximo venire comperimus. Nullae aliae voces exaudiebantur nisi illae: “Hei mihi, hei
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi! Crucior, disrumpor; lien, hepar, intestina omnia seditionem faciunt, eruptionem
  </p>
  <p>
   parant.” Erat nosocomium illud omnium ejus urbis maximum ac celeberrimum, ibique ad
  </p>
  <p>
   aegrotos procurandos magnus mercenariorum numerus conductus alebatur; quibus
  </p>
  <p>
   Magistri auctoritate et nomine imperabat senex quidam, ut dicebatur praeparcus et
  </p>
  <p>
   durus, qui nulli rei ita studebat ut parsimoniae. Verum nullum in ea re neque judicium
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   or their temples.

   203 secunda noctis vigilia: between 11 p.m. and midnight.
  </p>
  <p>
   134
  </p>
  <p>
   neque modum adhibebat; nam interdum, ut minam lucrifaceret, talentum magnum
  </p>
  <p>
   perdebat. At Gallonius, sive captus misericordia laborantium mercenariorum, sive vitio
  </p>
  <p>
   gentis humanae avidus cognoscendi quid esset: “Quid si adeamus, inquit, et
  </p>
  <p>
   laborantibus succurramus?” “Censeo,” ait Aemilius. Atque una omnes, succincti gladiis,
  </p>
  <p>
   miseris in auxilium properamus. Sed, nosocomium ingressi, perreptamus usque illud
  </p>
  <p>
   omne, ad coenationem, ad penum, ad tabernam aromatariam, quo non?204 neque
  </p>
  <p>
   quisquam occurrebat. Unum in valetudinario medicum cucurbitulas aegrotanti aeneas205
  </p>
  <p>
   applicantem offendimus, eidemque cruorem ex cute securi ducentem. Postremo cum
  </p>
  <p>
   fieret obviam nemo, secuti querentium sonitum latrinam intramus; ubi totam familiam
  </p>
  <p>
   ventris necessitate compulsam, coisse comperimus. Erant in eo loco stercorariae sellae
  </p>
  <p>
   plus quindecim, omnesque ad unam ab exonerantibus ventrem obsessae. Sed qui
  </p>
  <p>
   postremi accurrerant, rogabant primos, ut surgerent, ut locum darent; alii iracundiores,
  </p>
  <p>
   se iis in gremium alvum educturos minabantur; alii ad vim confugiebant, ac sellarum
  </p>
  <p>
   obsessores loco movere nitebantur; omnesque strepitu obscoeno simul atque odore
  </p>
  <p>
   locum implebant. Rogamus unum, qui surrexerat, unde natum esset quod omnes una
  </p>
  <p>
   atque eadem hora citata alvus206 exerceret? Respondet se id vino tribuere, quod in
  </p>
  <p>
   proxima coena bibissent. Etenim magister nosocomii, homo parcus ac tenax, cum
  </p>
  <p>
   faecis magnam vim pluribus ex doliis collectam projici nollet, consultavit cum cellario
  </p>
  <p>
   quemadmodum eam potantibus nobis obtruderet. Ille, ut a Magistro gratiam iniret:

   205 cucurbita or cucurbitula: cupping glasses for medical use. Cupping is a therapy in which heated glass
  </p>
  <p>
   cups are applied to the skin, creating suction as a way of stimulating blood flow. References to this
  </p>
  <p>
   technique are found, for example, in Juv. 14.58 and Plin. NH. XXXII.X.42.
  </p>
  <p>
   206 alvus cita: lax or loose bowels. This terminology can be found in medical texts, cf., Celsus, Med. I.6

  </p>
  <p>
   pauca ut conferam, faecem illam diligenter collectam, multa vappa diluit additisque
  </p>
  <p>
   ovorum vitellis,207 sulphure ac magna praesertim aluminis copia totam eliquat, ac pro

  <p>
   coepit singulis nobis alvus effluere atque acerbissimis doloribus distrahi. Haec
  </p>
  <p>
   audientes, in eum plane risum effundebamur ut prope ilia disrumperentur. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius bono eum animo esse jussit. Se enim sperare vinum illud ipsis medicae
  </p>
  <p>
   potionis loco futurum, quae lethales morbos averteret, quos pestilens anni tempus
  </p>
  <p>
   induxisset. Statimque discedimus, lectum repetimus, redormimus.

   Liber IV
  </p>
  <p>
   Postero die maturius multo quam pridie surreximus, ut reliquas ejus urbis
  </p>
  <p>
   regiones oculis lustraremus. Sed jam emanarat in vulgus, Dynastam Alexandrum ea
  </p>
  <p>
   nocte interiisse. Itaque plena erant omnia moeroris ac luctus; omnisque aetatis atque
  </p>
  <p>
   ordinis hominum ad ejus aedes, visendi gratia, concursus fiebant. Sed inter eos qui
  </p>
  <p>
   ibant et redibant, dynasta unus alteri dynastae occurrit; atque illico ambo consistunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   inter se amicissime salutant; uterque alteri sancte affirmat, nihil eo sibi jucundius
  </p>
  <p>
   quidquam neque carius esse. Tum pollicetur studium suum et operam sine ulla
  </p>
  <p>
   exceptione, aut laboris, aut occupationis, aut temporis; atque insuper addit, nihil fore ita
  </p>
  <p>
   arduum, ita difficile, quod pro eo susceptum sibi facile et jucundum non sit futurum. Hic
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius cachinnos extulit. Ego, admirans, quaesivi de illo quid rideret? Qui: “Rideo,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, quia non facile est invenire duos mortales majore inter se odio dissidentes, quam
  </p>
  <p>
   207 ovorum vitellis: egg yolks.
  </p>
  <p>
   136
  </p>
  <p>
   isti sint. Vide ut mali dissimulant, ut se amplectuntur, ut pollicentur operas mutuas. Alio
  </p>
  <p>
   hic more ac Romae vivitur, ubi indictae et apertae inimicitiae magis excercentur quam
  </p>
  <p>
   tacitae et occultae. Hic est frons omnium familiaris, multorum animus iratus, iracundiae
  </p>
  <p>
   occultae, blanditiae apertae.”208 Ac dicturus erat plura de illorum hominum moribus, nisi
  </p>
  <p>
   clamor ingens interpellasset. Quamobrem conversi magnam puerorum aliorumque
  </p>
  <p>
   catervam aspicimus, qui sibilis ac vocibus senem unum sectabantur, pallidum,
  </p>
  <p>
   squalidum, ac pene ab inferis reducem. Clamabat unus: “Heus tu! Quid apud inferos
  </p>
  <p>
   agitur? Suntne ibi popinae, caupones? Num ibi estur ac bibitur?” Vociferabatur alter:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Cur te noluit Orcus ad se recipere? Fortasse ut esset qui pueris in ludum ire
  </p>
  <p>
   recusantibus metum incuteret! Rogo te num tibi Pluto apodixim defunctoriam
  </p>
  <p>
   reddidit?”209 Alii: “Utinam Dynastae Alexandro, quem modo Pluto surripuit, hoc quasi
  </p>
  <p>
   postliminio210 ad nos redire contingeret! At hoc est optare quam sperare facilius.211 O
  </p>
  <p>
   factum male!212 Hic, quem aequum erat in tenebris esse, ad aspiciendum solem
  </p>
  <p>
   revocatur; ille, qui ob summum vitae splendorem clarissimum patriae suae lumen
  </p>
  <p>
   208 Cic. Flac. 87: “O condiciones miseras administrandarum provinciarum, in quibus diligentia plena
  </p>
  <p>
   simultatum est, neglegentia vituperationum, ubi severitas periculosa est, liberalitas ingrata, sermo
  </p>
  <p>
   insidiosus, adsentatio perniciosa, frons omnium familiaris, multorum animus iratus, iracundiae occultae,
  </p>
  <p>
   blanditiae apertae, venientis praetores exspectant, praesentibus inserviunt, abeuntis deserunt!”
  </p>
  <p>
   209 Petron. Sat. 132: “Rogo te, mihi apodixin [non] defunctoriam redde.” See also Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n.
  </p>
  <p>
   17.
  </p>
  <p>
   210 postliminium: A return to one’s threshold or one’s home; also, a return to one’s previous condition and
  </p>
  <p>
   former rank and privileges.
  </p>
  <p>
   211 The distinction between “optare” and “sperare” is the difference between the desire, respectively, for
  </p>
  <p>
   something impossible and the desire for something possible or achievable. Cicero makes this distinction
  </p>
  <p>
   throughout his works, for example, Cic. Rep. II.XVII.XXX.52: “civitatemque optandam magis quam
  </p>
  <p>
   sperandam”; Cic. De or. I.XXI.96: “Hoc loco Sulpicius ‘insperanti’ inquit ‘mihi et Cottae, sed valde optanti
  </p>
  <p>
   utrique nostrum cecidit, ut in istum sermonem, Crasse, delaberemini’”; Cic. Fam. 150 (IV.1): “itaque mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   venire in mentem nihil potest non modo, quod sperem, sed vix, iam quod audeam optare.”
  </p>
  <p>
   212 Catull. III.16: “o factum male! o miselle passer!”
  </p>
  <p>
   137
  </p>
  <p>
   extiterat, communis lucis usura privatur.” At nos, rei totius ignari, sciscitamur quaenam
  </p>
  <p>
   haec fabula sit. Eorum unus qui in jaciendis ridiculis ceteris argutior videbatur: “Audite,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, rem ridiculam. Hic qui tanto comitatu domum reducitur, elatus est pro mortuo,
  </p>
  <p>
   vivusque in conditorio depositus, ubi sine cibo triduum jacuit.” Quibus auditis,
  </p>
  <p>
   horruimus, ac majore etiam exarsimus cupiditate audiendi. Qui fecit huic nostrae
  </p>
  <p>
   cupiditati satis. “Sed antequam, inquit, ad rem aggrediar, necesse est, ut quid hic
  </p>
  <p>
   hominis sit vobis aperiam. Hoc quem nunc videtis placidum, demissum, quietum, non
  </p>
  <p>
   est truculentior quisquam neque flagitiis onustior; quamvis deflexu aetatis non parum de
  </p>
  <p>
   solita sua ferocitate et impotentia remiserit. Nam antea, supra quam dici potest, erat
  </p>
  <p>
   intemperans, iracundus, ebriosus, elatus, popino, manu et lingua promptus,213 in
  </p>
  <p>
   nocturnis bacchationibus princeps, in caedendis verberandisque hominibus dux aliis et
  </p>
  <p>
   magister, in excitanda turba ac seditione movenda prope singularis, in diris vero
  </p>
  <p>
   execrationibus nulla de causa in deos immortales jaciendis cuivis longe superior. At si
  </p>
  <p>
   ex factis praesertim judicare de hominum ingeniis licet, vel ex hoc uno ejus facinore,
  </p>
  <p>
   quo loco ac numero habendus sit existimate. Cum juvenis ad Pultiphagos venisset,
  </p>
  <p>
   homines barbaros atque a nostris moribus sane remotos, in quodam eorum pago
  </p>
  <p>
   deprehensus, interrogatusque quisnam esset: ‘Malum, inquit, quod vobis dii dent
  </p>
  <p>
   magnum et maturum, nebulones, sycophantae, latrones! Quid ea res ad vos attinet? Ite
  </p>
  <p>
   hinc in maximam malam crucem.’ Barbari tametsi non intelligerent, quae ab eo
  </p>
  <p>
   dicerentur, tamen ex habitu oris, ex oculorum conjectu, ex vi qua se eximere ex illorum
  </p>
  <p>
   vinculis conabatur, rati sibi ab eo maledici, statuunt de communi sententia eidem caput
  </p>
  <p>
   213 Cf. Sall. Iug. 44: “Sed ubi in Africam venit, exercitus [ei] traditus a Sp. Albino proconsule iners inbellis,
  </p>
  <p>
   neque periculi neque laboris patiens, lingua quam manu promptior.”
  </p>
  <p>
   138
  </p>
  <p>
   uno ictu praecidere. At videte imperterritum hominis animum, cum inter ipsorum tela
  </p>
  <p>
   versaretur, cum ad mortem raperetur, cum etiam collo suo ferrum imminere, cum se
  </p>
  <p>
   vulnerari sentiret: ‘Agite,’ clamabat, ‘impuri, latrones, carnifices! Vos ego ulciscar probe,
  </p>
  <p>
   si vivam.’ Verum cum eorum unus qui hoc sibi sumpserat, ut uno ictu securis caput illi a
  </p>
  <p>
   cervice repelleret, id, quod conatus erat, non perfecisset, graviter in collo vulneratum et
  </p>
  <p>
   ad terram abjectum reliquit. At ille, quod robustissima valetudine est, ex eo vulnere brevi
  </p>
  <p>
   convaluit. Tanta igitur accepta injuria, homo iracundus de referenda hominibus
  </p>
  <p>
   sacrilegis gratia sedulo cogitare, in varias cogitationes animum rapere, nullam partem
  </p>
  <p>
   quietis accipere. Sed cum jam pulchre omnia in corde instructa consilia haberet,214
  </p>
  <p>
   alacris castra movit atque ad suos hostes ire perrexit. Genus animadversionis
  </p>
  <p>
   cognoscite,215 et simul admiramini, tantum in uno homine fuisse animi ad audaciam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nocte quadam intempesta usus opportunitate ventorum, subjecto paucis quibusdam
  </p>
  <p>
   casis igne, totum fere illum pagum antea incendit, quam quisquam animadvertere aut
  </p>
  <p>
   animum recipere posset. Ipse autem, noctis beneficio occultatus in hanc urbem
  </p>
  <p>
   incolumis venit, ubi primum a dynasta Palladio in numerum suorum circumpedum
  </p>
  <p>
   receptus est; tum ab aliis deinceps dynastis pluribus. Sed demum homo inconstans ac
  </p>
  <p>
   levis, aulicam vitam pertaesus, ad uxorem habendam animum appulit. Ne multa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Muliercula quadam ducta, locat virginibus Vestalibus operas suas. Scitis cujusmodi sit
  </p>
  <p>
   mulierum genus, varium, morosum, superstitiosum, difficile. Ita eum bonae illae virgines
  </p>
  <p>
   exercebant, ut ne minimum quidem tempus quietum esse paterentur. Neque hibernis
  </p>
  <p>
   mensibus dies aliquis tam magna ac turbulenta tempestate erat, quin bis eundem in
  </p>
  <p>
   214 Ter. Phorm. II.ii.321: “iam instructa sunt mi in corde consilia omnia.”
  </p>
  <p>
   215 Cic. Verr. II.I. XVII.45: “Genus animadversionis videte: quaeretis ex quo genere hominem istum
  </p>
  <p>
   iudicetis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   139
  </p>
  <p>
   hortos Placidianos, qui millia quatuor absunt ab Urbe ad dynastam, in cujus patrocinio
  </p>
  <p>
   latent, ire compellerent. Quapropter, multorum mensium morbo ex frigore et labore
  </p>
  <p>
   contracto, denique medicorum sententia desperare de salute sua jubetur. Ille ridere ac
  </p>
  <p>
   medicos insanire dicere, se enim tum ipsis, tum liberis suis superstitem fore. At, dum his
  </p>
  <p>
   vocibus dicta medicorum eludit, linqui animo visus est, atque interclusus spiritus ita arte
  </p>
  <p>
   meare216 ut omnem plane sensum effugeret. Omnia quae solent esse in mortuis signa
  </p>
  <p>
   aderant: pallor oris, corporis totius rigor, nullus sensus. Ergo tanquam mortuo, funus
  </p>
  <p>
   curatur ab uxore, cui nihil longius videbatur quam dum cadaver illud domo efferretur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam saepe ob impotentiam viri, non solum appellabatur superbius, verum etiam
  </p>
  <p>
   pulsabatur acerbius. Tamen, ne in sermonem hominum vituperationemque veniret, non
  </p>
  <p>
   solum lacrimis sed etiam sumptu, ut pauperculae mulieris facultates ferunt, opinione
  </p>
  <p>
   sua extinctum supremo mandavit officio. Advocatis igitur libitinariis, mortuus effertur, in
  </p>
  <p>
   conditorio collocatur, ostium conditorii praecluditur. Vix dies unus intercesserat ab eo
  </p>
  <p>
   die ex quo fuerat sepultura affectus, cum interclusa anima ad vitae officia rediit
  </p>
  <p>
   experrectusque non una amplius nocte se cum uxore sua cubasse existimavit. Elatoque
  </p>
  <p>
   paululum capite, veniens ab ostio conditorii non bene praeclusi, tenue nescio quod
  </p>
  <p>
   lumen accepit, ac leviter cubito recens ibi positum mulieris cujusdam cadaver impellens:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Heus, inquit, Milphidippa,’ (nam id uxori ipsius est nomen), surge, atque aperi
  </p>
  <p>
   fenestram.’ Cui nihil Milphidippa respondit. Tum iterum: ‘Heus, inquit, erisne hodie
  </p>
  <p>
   evigilatura? Jam hora sumendae potionis a medico indicta praeteriit.’ Sed surdo
  </p>
  <p>
   fabulam narrabat. Quamobrem commotus: ‘Quid est hoc? ait, numne ad mortuos
  </p>
  <p>
   loquor? At foeminam vide! Antea cum valebam, semper ante lucem experrecta mihi
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   140
  </p>
  <p>
   somnum excutiebat; nunc cum nihil opus est somno, in eo tota defigitur.’ Sed cum
  </p>
  <p>
   lectulus ille solito sibi durior videretur, conatus est in alterum latus procumbere, ubi
  </p>
  <p>
   alterum hominis mortui cadaver offendit, quod quempiam uxoris suae moechum esse
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicatus, ‘Facinus indignum’! exclamat. ‘Pessima ista mihi ante oculos atque adeo in
  </p>
  <p>
   eundem lectum amatorem suum adduxit! Quid faceret, si me extinctum sepulchrum
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquod tegeret? Et quo me turpius irrideat, simulat dormire.’ Elatusque iracundia: ‘Mox,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, experiar, an suscitare te possim.’ Arreptoque altero ejus crure, coepit eam hac
  </p>
  <p>
   illac impellere. Sed vix crus illud in manus sumpsit, cum a reliquo corpore totum avellit
  </p>
  <p>
   atque distraxit. Quo facto, teterrimi odoris foeditate percussus, plane vehementer
  </p>
  <p>
   exhorruit. Quocirca manibus explorans quaerensque quae circa se essent diligentius,
  </p>
  <p>
   neque aliud nisi tabularum frusta atque ossa mortuorum attingens, tum demum agnovit
  </p>
  <p>
   quorum consederit arvis.217 Atque, ‘O me miserum! inquit, sepultus sum vivus. Aperite
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquis conditorium istud actutum!’
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed miser ignaras nequidquam haec dixit ad auras,218
  </p>
  <p>
   Quae nullas audire queunt nec reddere voces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Verum, sive deus aliquis eum respexit, sive casus adjuvit, in diebus paucis, quibus haec
  </p>
  <p>
   acta sunt, bajulus quidam moritur, atque in illud idem conditorium infertur. Sed aperto a
  </p>
  <p>
   vespillonibus ostio, clamare qui intus erat coepit: ‘Afferte mihi prandium; nam tertium
  </p>
  <p>
   jam diem sine alimento traho.’ Ad quam vocem exterriti tum vespillones, tum libitinarii,
  </p>
  <p>
   tum pollinctores, abjectis cereis, relictoque cadavere, fugae quantum potest sese

   Vel miser hic bajulus fortasse invitavit sese in popina plusculum221; quamobrem in
  </p>
  <p>
   somnum delapsus, antea quam crapulam exhalavit, pro mortuo ad sepulchrum
  </p>
  <p>
   abstrahitur. At illi, ubi paululum a timore animum receperunt, revertuntur et cum eo
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam cum infernis monstris prodigiisque loquuntur. Quibus ille: ‘Luditis me, inquit;
  </p>
  <p>
   ego vivo et esurio.’ Et cuncta ordine narravit. Qui, habita dicenti fide, extractum inde et
  </p>
  <p>
   cibo ac potione refectum, domum ad uxorem reducunt, quae utrum majore admiratione
  </p>
  <p>
   vel odio corripienda sit, in incerto est. Nam illuc isse virum rata, unde negant redire
  </p>
  <p>
   quemquam,222 alium ex sententia sua sponsum sibi delegerat.” Hic locus erat
  </p>
  <p>
   interpellandi:223 “Quam, inquam, illa cuperet ut eodem modo mortuorum hic funera
  </p>
  <p>
   curarentur quo Romae curantur, ubi eorum corpora ardentem in rogum conjiciuntur?
  </p>
  <p>
   Non aedepol nunc illa post funus virum suum domum redeuntem aspiceret.” “Credo, ait,
  </p>
  <p>
   si hic mos iste vigeret, ipsa rogum incendisset, ac suis virum manibus in ignem
  </p>
  <p>
   intulisset; tum, quo omni plane metu solveretur, collectos cineres in profluentem224
  </p>

   alibi regnum obtinere. Equidem, quod ad me attinet, non uspiam velim vitam exigere.”

   memoriam amittere. His actis, illum cum risu dimisimus, nos ad perlustranda cetera
  </p>
  <p>
   urbis loca perreximus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed tandem defessi ambulando, et quia diei fervidissimum tempus coeperat
  </p>
  <p>
   domum revertimur. Ubi ociosi, quid ageremus non habebamus. Nam neque prandii
  </p>
  <p>
   tempus advenerat, neque prius Gallonio potestas discumbendi dabatur quam dynastae
  </p>
  <p>
   ipsius confectum esset prandium mensaeque sublatae. Itaque minus nobis molestas
  </p>
  <p>
   antemeridianas illas horas elapsuras existimavimus, si eas cum Gallonio in illius
  </p>
  <p>
   dynastae aula traduxissemus, ubi facile multa sese oculis atque auribus objecissent,
  </p>
  <p>
   quae nos cum voluptate aliqua detinerent. Eo igitur imus, procoetonem intramus, in
  </p>
  <p>
   unum ejus angulum soli secedimus. At boni illi familiares, more suo, consumendi ocii
  </p>
  <p>
   causa, ad feriendam uniuscujusque existimationem linguae gladios exeruerant. Ac
  </p>
  <p>
   primum notae cujusdam mulieris famam lacerare coeperunt, tum alteri spectatae
  </p>
  <p>
   sanctitatis viro inveteratam illam probitatis ac fidei opinionem abrogare aggressi sunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Erat unus ex illis referens memoriter omnium ejus urbis meretricum nomina; atque
  </p>
  <p>
   earum multitudine, quae erat innumerabilis, ac memoriae vi, quae erat incredibilis,
  </p>
  <p>
   Cyrus videbatur, qui lustraret exercitum, ac suo quemque militem nomine appellaret.225
  </p>
  <p>
   225 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 23) refers to Val. Max. VIII.7 ext. 16: “Cyrus omnium militum suorum
  </p>
  <p>
   nomina . . . ediscendo . . . ut sine monitore exercitum salutaret.”
  </p>
  <p>
   143
  </p>
  <p>
   Alter convivatorem sordidum diris devovebat, quod sturnum pro turdo, vaccinam pro
  </p>
  <p>
   vitulina ipsi in prandium apposuisset. Sed postquam non erat quem amplius laederent,
  </p>
  <p>
   defessi maledicendo, in dynastam Alexandrum sermonem contulerunt; quem omnium
  </p>
  <p>
   medicorum opinione maturius extinctum affirmabant; praesertim cum neque aetate
  </p>
  <p>
   confecta, atque insuper robusta corporis firmitate esset. Tum quaerebant quemnam
  </p>
  <p>
   Rex amplissimo illi muneri, quo fungebatur, suffecturus esset ex iis, qui tantae spei
  </p>
  <p>
   imminebant, atque unusquisque, prout ejus studium ex amicitia, vel spe aliqua utilitatis
  </p>
  <p>
   flagrabat, alium alii anteponebat. Sed dum sermones caedunt,226 comparet unus in
  </p>
  <p>
   procoetone honesta facie, sed oculis in terram demissis, quem statim omnes adeunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   ambiunt, circumstant, et honorem nescio quem nuper adeptum gratulantur. Atque unus
  </p>
  <p>
   prae ceteris amore in eum ac benevolentia prope dilabi ac diffluere videbatur, adeo ut
  </p>
  <p>
   interdum collacrimaret, interdum haesitaret, tanquam si verba ad declarandam amoris
  </p>
  <p>
   magnitudinem apta non suppeterent. Gallonius mirari ac sudario risum compescere. Qui
  </p>
  <p>
   tandem ad nos accedens: “Non potest, inquit, dici, quos isti mihi cachinnos extorqueant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Videtis eum, cui tot gratulationes habentur? Hic paucis diebus ante apud nostrum
  </p>
  <p>
   dynastam multum auctoritate et gratia valebat, adeo ut ejus consilio et auctoritate domi
  </p>
  <p>
   omnia administrarentur. Quae illi res magnam invidiam concitavit multorumque paravit
  </p>
  <p>
   insidias. Quas ille animadvertens, satius esse duxit sponte loco decedere quam cum
  </p>
  <p>
   ignominia moveri. Verum, ne tam honorem deposuisse, quam permutasse videretur,
  </p>
  <p>
   impetravit a dynasta in beneficio et gratia aliam provinciam, in speciem quidem
  </p>
  <p>
   honestam atque magnificam, sed, re ipsa, totam nugatoriam ac levem. Venit igitur
  </p>
  <p>
   miser, ut dynastae gratias agat. Sed movet mihi risum in primis ille, qui ita docte
  </p>
  <p>
   226 Ter. Heaut. II.iii.242: “dum sermones caedimus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   144
  </p>
  <p>
   simulatione benevolentiae odium suum obtendit. Nam hoc homine nemo est illi
  </p>
  <p>
   capitalior neque infestior inimicus. Atque ejus praesertim opera inductus ac depravatus
  </p>
  <p>
   est dynasta invidia atque obtrectatione commodi ac laudis ejusdem. Vide, obsecro, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   malus simulat, ut blanditur subdole, ut frigidam malitiose suffundit.”227 Interea prosilit
  </p>
  <p>
   unus in medium atque: “Est mihi, inquit, in cubiculo oenophorum vini praestantissimi
  </p>
  <p>
   frigidissimique, quo nullum hac aestate dixerim me gustasse suavius. Flos vini est,
  </p>
  <p>
   Liberi lepos,228 atque una opera palatum vellit ac mulcet.” “Opportune, ait alter, nam ex
  </p>
  <p>
   quo surrexi, nondum vini quidquam exhausi et quod diei tempus sit, vides.” “Mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   quoque,” subdidit alius, “siccae siti fauces arent, quas nisi propero vino conspergere, in
  </p>
  <p>
   pulverem abeant.” Apprehensaque Gallonii dextera: “Sitim, inquit, sedatum eamus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Etenim te ea etiam enectum aspicio, et simul experiamur an vera sint, iste quae
  </p>
  <p>
   memorat.”229 Gallonius morem gerit, sequitur, et nos una quoque. Itaque omnes in
  </p>
  <p>
   cubiculum illius irruunt, oenophoro vim afferunt230 atque uno pene haustu omnem
  </p>
  <p>
   animam intercipiunt. Erat ibi olla ad ignem apposita, agninis carnibus plena, nondum
  </p>
  <p>
   satis excoctis. Has eorum unus ex aula diripit, in patinam infert atque etiam tum fervidas
  </p>
  <p>
   aufert in ventrem. Alter frustulatim panem in patina secat, supra jus injicit, caseum
  </p>
  <p>
   minute concisum aspergit,231 piper addit, devorat. At ille, qui vinum laudaverat, facti
  </p>
  <p>
   poenitens, quia prandium suum diripi videbat: “Quandoquidem, inquit, rogum
  </p>
  <p>
   227 Understand “aquam”; cf. Plaut. Cist. I.i.33-35: “eas si adeas, abitum quam aditum malis, ita nostro
  </p>
  <p>
   ordini / palam blandiuntur, clam, si occasio usquam est, / aquam frigidam subdole suffundunt.”
  </p>
  <p>
   228 Plaut. Curc. I.ii.96-8: “Flos veteris vini meis naribus obiectust, / eius amor cupidam me huc prolicit per
  </p>
  <p>
   tenebras. / ubi ubi est, prope me est. euax, habeo. / salve, anime mi, Liberi lepos.”
  </p>
  <p>
   229 The 1637 edition reads: “ . . . experiamur an vera sint. Iste, quae memorat, Gallonius morem gerit . . . ”
  </p>
  <p>
   230 vim afferre alicui: to do violence to someone.
  </p>
  <p>
   231 caseum minute concisum: grated cheese.
  </p>
  <p>
   145
  </p>
  <p>
   incendimus, cur non etiam hunc diem ferme ad umbilicum mortuum232 in eo
  </p>
  <p>
   comburimus, ac laeti prandemus?” “Sic agamus”, inquit ille qui panem ex jure vorabat;
  </p>
  <p>
   “jubeat unusquisque afferri quae sibi in prandium paraverat et in commune conferri.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Placuit omnibus ratio. At: “Ego commeatum, inquit Gallonius, spondeo, quod satis sit
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi atque istis duobus hospitibus meis.” Affert interea rumor, dynastam prandium
  </p>
  <p>
   poscere. Ad quam vocem Gallonius excitatus accurrit, quaeque opus sunt parat, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   ita multo post revertitur plenus reliquiarum. Etenim dynasta, quia crudior erat, nihil
  </p>
  <p>
   praeter jusculum degustaverat, cetera intacta reliquerat. Quo viso, mirabiliter sunt animi
  </p>
  <p>
   convivarum recreati, et unusquisque deos rogabat ut, quoties sibi cum Gallonio
  </p>
  <p>
   discumbendum esset, dynasta crudus existeret. His dictis, omnes cum risu soleas
  </p>
  <p>
   ponunt, lectos inscendunt. Qui risus duplicatur interventu cujusdam litterati, quem pridie
  </p>
  <p>
   inter academicos illos me vidisse memineram. Hunc esse ajebant philosophum
  </p>
  <p>
   summum, oratorem egregium, quique auderet in conventu poscere qua de re quisque
  </p>
  <p>
   vellet audire. Sed hominem voluptarium et conviviis flagitiisque deditum conclamant
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes ut adeat, soleas exuat, discumbat. Qui non patitur diu se rogari, sed statim
  </p>
  <p>
   ascendit ac summus accumbit. Itaque hilariter estur, bibitur. Sed ubi saburrati recte sunt
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes,233 inducitur sermo de mulieribus ejus civitatis, quas, paucis exceptis, criminibus
  </p>
  <p>
   avaritiae impudicitiaeque coarguunt. At ego, ne mutus viderer: “Ex omnibus, inquam,
  </p>
  <p>
   orbis terrae matronis nullas arbitror Romanis castitate pudicitiaque anteire; plenae sunt
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes historiae, plena antiquitatis memoria.” Tum philosophus ille, qui hos sermones
  </p>
  <p>
   lacessiverat: “Tu mihi videris, inquit, in historiis Romanorum sane rudis atque hospes,
  </p>
  <p>
   232 Plaut. Men. I.ii.154-5: “Age sane igitur, quando aequom oras, quam mox incendo rogum? / dies
  </p>
  <p>
   quidem iam ad umbilicum est dimidiatus mortuos.”
  </p>
  <p>
   233 saburratus: weighed down with food; cf. Plaut. Cist. I.ii.121: “quae ubi saburratae sumus.”

  </p>
  <p>
   qui non legisti quid Salustius, Romanae princeps historiae, de Fulvia, de Sempronia ac
  </p>
  <p>
   de multis ejus aevi mulieribus scriptum reliquerit. Vel si haec non noris, ne ad aures
  </p>
  <p>
   quidem tuas pervenere quae super ea re Horatius, Romanae fidicen lyrae,234 cecinerit?
  </p>
  <p>
   cujus ego versus possum tibi recitare memoriter:
  </p>
  <p>
   Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos
  </p>
  <p>
   Matura virgo, et fingitur artubus
  </p>
  <p>
   Iam nunc, et incestos amores
  </p>
  <p>
   De tenero meditatur ungui.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mox juniores quaerit adulteros
  </p>
  <p>
   Inter mariti vina, neque eligit
  </p>
  <p>
   Cui donet impermissa raptim
  </p>
  <p>
   Gaudia, luminibus remotis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed jussa coram non sine conscio
  </p>
  <p>
   Surgit marito, seu vocat institor,
  </p>
  <p>
   Seu navis Hispanae magister,
  </p>
  <p>
   Dedecorum preciosus emptor.235
  </p>
  <p>
   Potuitne magis diserte projectos mulierum Romanarum ad omnem libidinem et
  </p>
  <p>
   intemperantiam mores exprimere?” Tum ego, deprehensus quemadmodum me
  </p>
  <p>
   expedirem non inveniebam, sed quo aliquid responderem: “Quid ais, inquam, de
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucretia? Nonne omnium pudicarum coryphaea236 dici jure optimo potest, quae
  </p>
  <p>
   Tarquinii injuriam ita in se graviter animadvertit? Quid potuit facere elegantius mulier
  </p>
  <p>
   cupida existimationis bonae, quam ereptae sibi pudicitiae dolorem voluntaria morte
  </p>
  <p>
   testari, tanquam si nulla ea vita sit, quae a pudicitia spiritum non ducat?” “Longe alia
  </p>
  <p>
   mea est opinio de Lucretia, inquit ille, atque ea quae in animis omnium inveteravit. Ego
  </p>
  <p>
   enim nullam illi virtutem, nullam continentiae laudem assigno. Nam a Tarquinio
  </p>
  <p>
   oppressa vel consensit stupro, vel non. Si consensit, immerito principem inter pudicas

  </p>
  <p>
   locum usurpat. Si non consensit, cur maluit violata sibi necem afferre quam intacta a
  </p>
  <p>
   Tarquinio necari? Fortasse, inquies, quo se pudicitiamque suam existimationi hominum
  </p>
  <p>
   vindicaret. Nam si statim Tarquinio jugulum praebuisset, ideo ab eo interempta
  </p>
  <p>
   putaretur, quod cum servo adulterium commisisset. Ergo erat aliquid quod sibi magis
  </p>
  <p>
   cordi esset quam pudicitia, nempe hominum existimatio. Nam, si sola virtute duceretur,
  </p>
  <p>
   quae, praeter conscientizam, nullius praeterea testimonium desiderat, quid de se
  </p>
  <p>
   homines loquerentur non admodum laborasset. At si ad intimum hujus facti cubile
  </p>
  <p>
   penetremus, ab hoc suspicionis aditu januaque patefacta, aliquod fortasse latens in eo
  </p>
  <p>
   crimen inveniemus. Quomodo enim Tarquinius potuit, concubia nocte, penetrare in
  </p>
  <p>
   cubiculum mulieris, multis, ut fit verisimile, pessulis clausum? Quomodo custodes
  </p>
  <p>
   mulieris fallere? Cur a Tarquinio oppressa non exclamavit? Ita enim familia tota
  </p>
  <p>
   accurrisset ac scelerosus ille vel incoepto destitisset, vel si Lucretiam reluctantem
  </p>
  <p>
   enecasset, multos sceleris sui, multos pudicitiae illius testes fecisset.” Nullum fecisset
  </p>
  <p>
   finem dicendi philosophus multo Liberi flore completus, nisi exorta inter convivas turba
  </p>
  <p>
   dicentem interpellasset. Erat unus in iis, ut postea animadvertimus, ejus notae
  </p>
  <p>
   hominum, qui cibum e flamma praeripiunt. Hic precibus extorserat, ut in illum gregem
  </p>
  <p>
   admitteretur, sed vix lectum conscenderat, cum coepit ad omnes patinas procaces
  </p>
  <p>
   manus extendere atque lectissimos ex iis bolos excerpere, tanquam si sibi soli
  </p>
  <p>
   prandium illud esset appositum. Ecce autem, primis escis assumptis, gallina Indica
  </p>
  <p>
   magno in catino porrecta succenturiatur,237 iis condita condimentis, ut nidore suo non
  </p>
  <p>
   latentem modo famem evocaret, verum etiam demortuam excitaret. Homo aequissimus,
  </p>
  <p>
   237 succenturio: to receive as a recruit into a centuria; also, to put in the place of another, receive as a
  </p>
  <p>
   substitute (very rare per L&amp;S).
  </p>
  <p>
   148
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam si de ea captus esset judex, accito puero, quem suis imperiis praesto habebat
  </p>
  <p>
   ad januam, indicta causa, obvoluto eam capite domum suam auferri in exilium jubet,
  </p>
  <p>
   atque antea se exulem insons aspexit quam posset de defensione cogitare. Quo viso,
  </p>
  <p>
   ceteri convivae mirari, inter se aspicere, atque ad ejus impudentiam, sine voce ac sine
  </p>
  <p>
   ullo sensu haerere. Sed hilaritas, quae praeoccupaverat mentes, nullum dabat
  </p>
  <p>
   iracundiae locum, sed omnes, dissimulato dolore, in suscepta festivitate perseveravere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jam convivium properabat ad exitum, cum testuacea238 placenta, in repositorio
  </p>
  <p>
   collocata, tanquam in exodium prandii proponitur. Ut ille, qui gallinam Indicam aliam
  </p>
  <p>
   capere civitatem jusserat, advenientem eam aspexit, fecit ingenium suum,239 atque illi
  </p>
  <p>
   miserae imperat, ut domum suam in exilium eat ac vestigiis iisdem gallinam Indicam
  </p>
  <p>
   sequatur. Praesto adest puer, qui obtorta gula eam abripiat.240 Tum vero victa est
  </p>
  <p>
   convivarum patientia, et simul omnes: “Enimvero hoc non est ferendum!” exclamant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed cerebrosior unus: “Nunquam hodie, me vivo, haec placenta mutabit coloniam.”241
  </p>
  <p>
   Abreptamque ad se coepit attrahere; ille retrahere ac vim sibi fieri dicere. Verum
  </p>
  <p>
   omnium minis perterritus, eorumque qui ipsi assidebant objurgationibus correptus, se
  </p>
  <p>
   demum ab incepto removit, et in cubitum reposuit.242 Confecto prandio, unus ex
  </p>
  <p>
   convivis, cui alea vita erat, talos poscit ac philosophum in aleam provocat. Nos, cum
  </p>
  <p>
   somnus invaderet, surreximus atque in domum Gallonii perreximus, ubi pomeridianum

  <p>
   illud tempus partim legendo, partim quiescendo transmisimus. Sed cum jam calor
  </p>
  <p>
   remisisset: “Eundum est nobis, inquit Gallonius, in aedem Daphnes, quo universus hic
  </p>
  <p>
   populus hodie conveniet. Nam inde nobilissimus ille dynasta extinctus
  </p>
  <p>
   magnificentissimo funere efferetur in aedem a se aedificatam, ut sepulturae mandetur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam mos hic est defunctos in aedibus deorum humare.” At ego: “Duc nos, inquam, eo;

  <p>
   nam nihil est quod magis visendum existimemus.” Ne multa; domo egressi, ad aedem
  </p>
  <p>
   Aesculapii venimus, quam magna refertam turba videmus. Intramus, atque inter cereos
  </p>
  <p>
   quatuor positum adolescentis cadaver aspicimus. Rogat Gallonius, quisnam sit ille
  </p>
  <p>
   mortuus, quidve illi ad eum concursus velint. Respondetur eum esse Philotam
  </p>
  <p>
   quendam, cujus amore duae illae mulieres adolescentes paucis diebus ante interiissent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam eundem, earum intellecta morte, animum despondisse, ex eaque aegritudine in eo
  </p>
  <p>
   nosocomio vita migrasse. Quaero ex Gallonio quem ille Philotam, quas mulieres narret?
  </p>
  <p>
   Qui: “Res, inquit, digna est auditu; sed eam plane ita uti se habet explicare non
  </p>
  <p>
   possum.” “Ego, ait unus, vobis narrabo, si causa est cur audiatis, atque in verba
  </p>
  <p>
   conferam quam paucissima.” At ego: “Narra nobis, inquio, nec verbis parce; nam rem
  </p>
  <p>
   gratissimam feceris.” Quamobrem ille sic exorsus est.

  <p>
   “In oppido quodam insulae, huic regno finitimae, ubi Theridates rex summa cum
  </p>
  <p>
   laude justitiae Rempublicam gerit, virgo erat nubilis, Olinda nomine, genere et copiis
  </p>
  <p>
   haud quidem summis, sed vultu adeo eleganti, adeo venusto, ut oculos in se omnium
  </p>
  <p>
   alliceret. Sed in primis Philotae, ejus civitatis longe primi, ita ad se animum attraxit, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   vitam illi miseram et insuavem efficeret. Cum igitur amore ac moerore miser
  </p>
  <p>
   150
  </p>
  <p>
   contabesceret, fecit id quod cuivis venisset in mentem,243 ut parentem virginis societate
  </p>
  <p>
   amicitiaque sibi conjungeret; in quo fuit felix, nam totum hominem brevi possedit. Verum
  </p>
  <p>
   cum ejus domum ventitaret, atque oculis, vultu, voce denique ipsa, amorem virgini
  </p>
  <p>
   suum significaret, parem in ea voluntatem ardoremque, id quod raro contingit, invenit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itaque, usi licentia, quam ejus regionis mos tribuit, non cessabant inter se amplexari
  </p>
  <p>
   oscularique. Sed cum eorum oscula modum excederent, coeperunt esse suspecta
  </p>
  <p>
   parentibus Olindae, cupidis in primis existimationis bonae. Quamobrem ab homini
  </p>
  <p>
   nobili, atque id aetatis pudicitiae filiae non parum metuentes, aliquo eam praesidio
  </p>
  <p>
   munire constituunt. Sed cum nullum sit tam firmum praesidium, quod non longa
  </p>
  <p>
   obsidione demum hostis expugnet, consuetudinem filiae cum adolescente dirimere
  </p>
  <p>
   statuunt, eumque domi suae finibus quantum potest expellere. Ne multa; adolescentem
  </p>
  <p>
   adeunt; quid de ejus amore compertum habeant edocent; ostendunt quam perniciosum
  </p>
  <p>
   futurum sit filiae, si propter ipsum in sermonem hominum veniat. Orant, obsecrant, ne
  </p>
  <p>
   tantam illi infamiam creet, sed ejus conspectum atque adeo totam illam domum effugiat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Respondet adolescens nullum se voluisse virgini dedecus, nullam ipsius contumeliam
  </p>
  <p>
   imponere; jam inde ab initio conjugium animo concepisse; hac nuptiarum fiducia, multa
  </p>
  <p>
   sibi persuasa habuisse. Rogat, instat ut eam uxorem sibi despondeant. Illi non aequam
  </p>
  <p>
   esse suam factionem cum factione illius ostendunt: se modicis opibus ac mediocri
  </p>
  <p>
   nobilitate esse; illum summis opibus ac summo genere natum; rem esse periculosam
  </p>
  <p>
   repente ab asinis, ut dicitur, ad boves ascendere.244 Proinde aliam sibi conditionem,
  </p>
  <p>
   alias nuptias quaereret. Postremo, cum magis exoraret, ita Philotas ab eis discedit ut

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   151
  </p>
  <p>
   qui rem etiam atque etiam consideraturos, et cum parentibus ipsius sermocinaturos
  </p>
  <p>
   affirment. Non procrastinant; Philotae parentes adeunt, rem narrant. Illi gratias agunt;
  </p>
  <p>
   consilium dant ut Olindae sponsum quam primum inveniant. Sunt omnes ejus regionis
  </p>
  <p>
   ad subita et repentina consilia propensi. Itaque parentes Olindae statim illi virum
  </p>
  <p>
   inveniunt, adolescentem quidem nobilem, sed nihil ad Philotam. Nuptiae statim fiunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   aguntur omnia raptim atque turbate. Verum tam praeceps consilium adeo impendentem
  </p>
  <p>
   vim malorum ab Olindae peste non repulit, ut in eam etiam celerius attraxerit. Nam eo
  </p>
  <p>
   connubio mutuus ille inter Olindam et Philotam amor nihil remissior est factus. Atque
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus horis Philotas ante aedes Olindae conspiciebatur, non sine viciniae atque adeo
  </p>
  <p>
   gravi ipsius viri offensione. Qui per amicos Philotam admonendum curavit, ut, nisi
  </p>
  <p>
   malam rem quaereret, eas regiones prorsus effugeret. Erat in Philota, ut in plerisque
  </p>
  <p>
   nobilium, contemptor animus et superbia. Ergo negligere, ac pergere illac progredi. Hac
  </p>
  <p>
   insolentia permotus, vir Olindae die quadam transeuntem eum, neque dum tale aliquid
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicantem, lato gladio caedit et in fugam conjicit. Nolite quaerere quantas haec tam
  </p>
  <p>
   insignis injuria homini iracundo et in primis elato faces admoverit. Amenti similis domum
  </p>
  <p>
   accurrit, gladium arripit, revertitur, inimicum suum etiam tum in ostio stantem aggreditur,
  </p>
  <p>
   eundemque fortissime dimicantem sub oculis suae Olindae transverberat. Res illico in
  </p>
  <p>
   judicium adducitur, adolescens tota insula conquiritur; sed ille jam evolarat atque huc
  </p>
  <p>
   recta contenderat. At judex quaestionis impulsu affinium clamantium Olindam fuisse illi
  </p>
  <p>
   caedi caput, eam abripi et in carcerem condi imperat. Ergo misera e complexu
  </p>
  <p>
   parentum ad tribunal judicis, e geniali thoro in carcerem rapitur. Sed vix intro in
  </p>
  <p>
   carcerem pedem tulit, cum ad alterum eam saxum nova tempestas afflixit. Etenim non
  </p>
  <p>
   in misericordiam modo prolapsus est custodis carcerum animus, sed amore vinctae
  </p>
  <p>
   152
  </p>
  <p>
   exarsit. Scitis quam.245 Noctu ad mulierem adit; ut sibi morigera sit rogat; eam se
  </p>
  <p>
   ducturum uxorem domum affirmat; dexteram in id quod spondebat, obligandae fidei
  </p>
  <p>
   causa, praebet.246 Respondet illa, non esse tum ei rei locum; neque decere miseram,
  </p>
  <p>
   sordidatam, in judicium capitis adductam, ac de vinculis dicere causam coactam, prope
  </p>
  <p>
   funestas nuptias facere; expectaret dum e vinculis eximeretur. His sermonibus aegre ab
  </p>
  <p>
   ea homo ille repellitur. Sed cum cupido magis instaret, ab amore seu potius a furore
  </p>
  <p>
   consilium mutuatur. Equum comparat, zonam cum viatico sumit, seque fugae cum
  </p>
  <p>
   Olinda committit. Ubi in quandam silvam ventum est, custos carceris, cui nihil longius
  </p>
  <p>
   videbatur quam dum in Olindae complexum irrueret, simulata lassitudine, ex equo
  </p>
  <p>
   descendit, seque in eam cupide rejicit. Illa eum a se repellere, neque adhuc se esse
  </p>
  <p>
   liberam dicere. Ille orare ut sibi subveniret, ut ferret morienti auxilium; multaque id
  </p>
  <p>
   genus addere, sed nihil proficere. Minari incipere,247 tantundem. Ubi eam videt nihilo
  </p>
  <p>
   magis minis quam precibus permoveri, ad vim confugit, atque extorquere ab ea
  </p>
  <p>
   complexum nititur. Illa repugnat, unguibus ac dentibus petit; sed iniqua concertatio quae
  </p>
  <p>
   cum valentiore suscipitur. Jam nulla ad resistendum ratio supererat, jam prope erat ut
  </p>
  <p>
   succumberet, cum nova res victoriam illi certissimam attulit, et pudicitiam in tuto
  </p>
  <p>
   constituit. Dum luctat, animadvertit homini pugionem in zona pendere. Tum alacris
  </p>
  <p>
   furtim eductum, ejus lateri quantum potest infigit; seque ita ambitiosissimis odiosi illius
  </p>
  <p>
   amplexibus expedit. Jam vero quid faciat? quid consilii capiat? Sola est, mulier,
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescentula, nullus neque amicus, neque comes; loca aspera, deserta, devia. Non

  </p>
  <p>
   despondet animum, non abjicit, verum ad superius alterum virilis audaciae facinus
  </p>
  <p>
   addit.248 Muliebre vestimentum exuit, virile ex misero illo detractum induit, marsupium
  </p>
  <p>
   eripit, equum conscendit, atque amatorem suum, ubiubi ille sit, invenire constituit. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   ad tantum iter viaticata admodum aestive erat.249 Etenim nondum ex insula pedem
  </p>
  <p>
   extulerat, cum pauxillulum illud nummorum, quod invenerat in marsupio, consumpserat,
  </p>
  <p>
   insuper equum vendiderat. Quamobrem fuit illi necesse homini cuidam nobili operas
  </p>
  <p>
   suas pro ephebo locare. Ecce autem novas tricas, nova incommoda. Erat illi filia virgo
  </p>
  <p>
   nubilis, forma non mala, cujus ad oculos simul ac recens ephebi pulchritudo pervenit,
  </p>
  <p>
   tantum etiam cordi confecit ardoris quantum maximum capere pectus virginis potest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed illa nihil amabat; fumum atque umbram persequebatur. At primo amorem suum
  </p>
  <p>
   ephebo oculis, vultu significare. Olinda, in amoribus longe robustioribus occupata, non
  </p>
  <p>
   animadvertere. Tum illa, adolescentem existimans in amore rudem ac tardum, voce
  </p>
  <p>
   exponere, quod vultu intelligeret minus, atque orare ut sibi suppetias laboranti sufferret.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olinda, quae sibi esset conscia auxilium quod expetebatur apud se non inveniri, risu
  </p>
  <p>
   dicta virginis excipere. Illa se illudi existimans: ‘Quid est, inquit, quod rides? num
  </p>
  <p>
   propterea tibi deridiculo sum, quia pereo? Ah ne saevi tantopere.’ Tum Olinda: ‘Ubi,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, me noveris, continuo omnis de me amor effluxerit, et amori odium successerit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed obsecro, si quid amas, ne patri neque cuiquam mortalium, indicium facias. Mihi non
  </p>
  <p>
   magis virilis sexus inest quam matri tuae, quam tibi. In manu tua est, quod minus credis,
  </p>
  <p>
   experiri. At, si quid istuc ornati sit quaeris,250 dicam: Amor me et capitis periculum in has

  </p>
  <p>
   154
  </p>
  <p>
   vestes conjecit, ac virum mentiri coëgit.’ Ac protinus, unde esset, quem amaret, quem
  </p>
  <p>
   occidisset, quo tenderet, cuncta ordine narravit. Postremo orare coepit, ut auxilium sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   nummarium, cujus esset in primis egens, afferret; hoc est, ut se viatico juvaret huc
  </p>
  <p>
   properantem. Quid? Existimatisne eam hac re tam inopinata percussam, spem vel
  </p>
  <p>
   amorem animo abjecisse? Nihil minus; imo utrumque constantissime tenuit. Credo quod
  </p>
  <p>
   in fabulis legisset, vel ex aliqua anicula audisset, olim nonnullam ex foemina in virum
  </p>
  <p>
   fuisse conversam. Existimabat idem illi, quam amabat, posse contingere. Sed attendite
  </p>
  <p>
   quo progrediatur. In Olindae complexum ruens, affirmat se sine ea nunquam unum
  </p>
  <p>
   diem esse victuram. ‘Ecquae mihi vita, inquit, expetenda est, si a te divellar? Nulla
  </p>
  <p>
   quidem certe. Bono animo es; mihi certum ac deliberatum est tecum una proficisci,
  </p>
  <p>
   eandemque fortunam subire.’ Multa dixit Olinda, quo virginem de sententia dejiceret,
  </p>
  <p>
   sed laterem lavit.251 Quid multis moror?252 Auro, argento, aliisque preciosis rebus
  </p>
  <p>
   convasatis, postridie, cum parens rus isset, una cum Olinda huc versus castra movit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quo celeriter secundo anni tempore253 perveniunt, et ad cauponem ambae divertunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Licebat eas cernere virili cultu tota passim urbe pervagari, ac formae praestantia
  </p>
  <p>
   omnium ad se oculos rapere. Quam multos fuisse putatis qui eas sub illo ornatu puellas
  </p>
  <p>
   esse contenderent? Sed ejus in primis facies enitebat, quae amatorem suum
  </p>
  <p>
   quaeritatum advenerat. Sed jam omnia odoranti investigantique suboleverat eum in hac
  </p>
  <p>
   urbe versari. Quamobrem, hisce leviter pressis vestigiis, eum secuta, tandem, proh

   dolor, invenit jam aliquot dies immersum in ganeo meretrici cuidam operam dare. Ergo
  </p>
  <p>
   dolore amens: ‘Itane, Philota, inquit, prorsus oblitus es mei? Ergo frustra tantum
  </p>
  <p>
   laborem, tantam infamiam cepi? Dum propter te patria carens, impudicae cujusdam
  </p>
  <p>
   more perambulo; tu interea loci254 te oblectasti, ac meretricios amores nuptiis
  </p>
  <p>
   praeposuisti?’ Illico despondet animum, morbumque ex aegritudine contrahit. Rem
  </p>
  <p>
   incredibilem. Ubi haec aegra fit, continuo illa altera aegrotare incipit; huic morbus
  </p>
  <p>
   augescit, fit illi etiam amplior. Postremo haec moritur, mors itidem illam alteram occupat;
  </p>
  <p>
   ambarumque cadavera eodem die, eodem funere, eodem feretro in aedem Cupidinis
  </p>
  <p>
   elata sunt, atque una eademque sepultura affecta ut, quarum animos amor in vita
  </p>
  <p>
   junxisset, mors distrahere non potuisset, earum corpora unum atque idem sepulchrum
  </p>
  <p>
   haberet. Redeo ad Philotam, qui tantum mali insciens dederat. Qui simul ac certior est
  </p>
  <p>
   factus (nam Olinda ferme jam moriens rem omnem narraverat) continuo exanimatus ad
  </p>
  <p>
   aedes Olindae contendit, commodum cum ea jam effereretur, et fusus in lacrymas:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Ergo, mea voluptas, tibi mortis causa fui? Nunquam me tantum a te amari intellexi. Me
  </p>
  <p>
   miserum, non potuisse me tali ingenio frui! Sed itidem de te aegritudo mihi vitam eripiet.
  </p>
  <p>
   O praeclarum255 e vita discessum, si in tuo complexu animam efflare licuisset!’ Atque
  </p>
  <p>
   ibat, ut sese in Olindae cadaver abjiceret; sed aegre retentus, demum inde pro mortuo
  </p>
  <p>
   in domum amici ac popularis cujusdam sui refertur. Sed cum morbus augesceret, nec
  </p>
  <p>
   satis diligenter curari videretur, idem amicus in hoc nosocomium perferendum curavit,
  </p>
  <p>
   ubi viri nobiles apto in loco victu ac ceteris rebus quam commodissime habentur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Verum, propter anni tempus grave, locum multitudine aegrotantium refertum invenerunt.

   Quamobrem tantisper, dum aliquis convalesceret, fuit eum necesse inter plebeculam
  </p>
  <p>
   collocare. Homo nobilissimus, ac suae civitatis primus, cum se inter faecem urbis
  </p>
  <p>
   conjectum vidisset, tanta vi aegritudinis oppressus est, ut illo ipso die sit mortuus. Hic
  </p>
  <p>
   fuit finis amantium. Itaque, ut videtis”:
  </p>
  <p>
   Durius in terris nihil est, quod vivat, amante;
  </p>
  <p>
   Nec, modo si sapias, quod minus esse velis.256
  </p>
  <p>
   Excierat nobis lacrymas funestus miserorum amantium casus, atque erat aliquid
  </p>
  <p>
   quod volebam percontari; sed praeripuit mihi clamor puerorum, admonentium
  </p>
  <p>
   appropinquare pompam funeris, quo dynasta mortuus efferebatur. Ad quas voces ille
  </p>
  <p>
   accurrit, et nos etiam cupidos videndi secum attraxit. Erat totum illud agmen instructum
  </p>
  <p>
   hoc modo: Anteibant pueri puellaeque, quarum magnus erat numerus, quas illius
  </p>
  <p>
   misericordia sustentabat. Sequebantur collegia varia, quae in ejus tutela latebant. Hos
  </p>
  <p>
   excipiebant candidati complures, qui inflexa ad miserabilem sonum voce,257 diis
  </p>
  <p>
   manibus flebile carmen atque funestum canebant. Tum ad cereos circiter quadringentos
  </p>
  <p>
   efferebatur dynastae cadaver, in lecto purpura auroque constrato. Funus, honoris
  </p>
  <p>
   gratia, prosequebantur dynastae ceteri, qui praeeuntibus ipsorum familiaribus, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   praeterea magno assectatorum numero, bini incedebant. Ordinabant agmen
  </p>
  <p>
   designatores non pauci, stipati lictoribus atratis. Quacunque funus pergeret,
  </p>
  <p>
   personabant viae fletibus, percrepabat caelum ejusmodi vocibus:
  </p>
  <p>
   Nunc tempus lacrymas,258 nunc querimonias,

   Et tristi gemitus fundere carmine;

   259 Editions 1637 and 1645 read “ingens” the corrigenda at the end of the 1645 edition replace this
  </p>
  <p>
   adjective with “insignis” (which is how it reads in Eud. 1998). I thank Mark T. Riley for explaining that the
  </p>
  <p>
   correction was necessitated because “ingens” is unmetrical.

   Sed diei tempus admonebat, ut de coena cogitaremus, quocirca Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   servum suum obsonatum misit. Interim perductus est ad nos nauclerus quidam, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   perendie a prandio, si ventus operam dedisset, explicaturus erat vela264 in insulam, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   ajebat, amoenissimam feracissimamque, cujus insulae cives essent homines quieti,
  </p>
  <p>
   hilares, jucundi, voluptarii, itaque de naulo265 cum illo convenimus. Postea abire
  </p>
  <p>
   coepimus ad fontem ibi proximum, calorem discussuri qui membris inhaeserat. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   quidam rheda vectus inhibuit. Qui magna voce inquit: “O te ipsum, Galloni, volebam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quaeso, nisi est negocium, paululum da mihi operam; etenim te convento opus est.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Ubi libet, inquit Gallonius, tuus sum.” At ille proxime ad Gallonium accedens, pauca illi
  </p>
  <p>
   quaedam in aurem instillat, rogatque, ut dynastae suo refundat. Postremo interrogat
  </p>
  <p>
   nos, unde veniamus. Respondet Gallonius: “Ex aede Daphnes, quo duos istos
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescentes, populares meos, adduxi, homines nobiles ac litteris266 deditos, qui etiam
  </p>
  <p>

   tibine Virgilius serpere humi videtur?”267 “Tibi quoque idem videatur, ait, ubi mea

  </p>
  <p>
   quod ais? Sane pudeat me Virgilianis similes versus efficere et, si imperarem, ex

   269 Alain de Lille, Anticlaudianus 1.71-3: “Quicquid depascit oculos uel inhebriat aures, / Seducit gustum,
  </p>
  <p>
   nares suspendit odore, / Demulcet tactum, retinet locus iste locorum.” This is the first of five almost direct
  </p>
  <p>
   quotations from Alain de Lille’s allegorical work Anticlaudianus de Antirufino. Composed between 1181
  </p>
  <p>
   and 1184, the Anticlaudianus is a response to Claudian’s Against Rufinus, in which Claudian depicts the
  </p>
  <p>
   purely evil man. In Alain de Lille’s allegory, the protagonist Nature sets herself the task of producing the
  </p>
  <p>
   completely good man by soliciting the aid of the Virtues, led by Prudence, with Reason, Concord, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Theology providing guidance (Alain de Lille and Sheridan 1973: 23-7). The first book of the the
  </p>
  <p>
   Anticlaudianus contains a description (beginning at l. 55) of Nature’s garden, an idyllic and beautiful
  </p>
  <p>
   place, providing Rossi with ample vocabulary and phrases to describe welcome Spring. It is amusing that

   this blowhard man arrogantly declares himself superior to Virgil and shows off his “rerum verborumque
  </p>
  <p>
   copia” by quoting directly from de Lille, who, with this digression on Nature’s house, places himself solidly
  </p>
  <p>
   in the tradition of the bucolic poetry for which Virgil was famous.

  </p>
  <p>
   275 Anticlaudianus: 1.100-2: “Exuit ingentes faeces argenteus amnis / Ad puri remeans elementi jura,
  </p>
  <p>
   nitore / Fulgurat in proprio, peregrina fece solutus.”

  </p>
  <p>
   numerus prope numerum verborum exaequat! Ego primus elegans hoc scribendi genus
  </p>
  <p>
   inveni, in medium protuli, in morem induxi; ego hanc viam aperui, lustravi, meis vestigiis
  </p>
  <p>
   impressi; quae qui voluerit persequi, ad nominis aeternitatem sine errore perveniet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sume igitur hoc carmen meo chirographo scriptum, illudque tibi ad poësin magistrum
  </p>
  <p>
   adopta.” Dum accipio et gratias ago. “Quid si, inquit Gallonius, ejus epistolas legeres?
  </p>
  <p>
   Profecto ex Pythagorae sententia diceres immigrasse in eum animum Ciceronis, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   ejusdem eloquentiam haereditate ad eum pervenisse.” His auditis, sane commotus est
  </p>
  <p>
   totus ac: “Facis mihi, inquit, injuriam. Nam pluris est una aut altera scriptionis cujusvis
  </p>
  <p>
   meae linea quam centum Ciceronis epistolae. Quid est, dii boni, in eo oratore nisi
  </p>
  <p>
   incitatus verborum cursus, ac sine sanguine ac nervis flaccescens oratio.”277 Plura
  </p>
  <p>
   dicturum in Ciceronem rediens a funere Alexandri dynasta quidam inhibuit, qui rheda
  </p>
  <p>
   exceptum ab oculis nostris abduxit. Quaero postea ex Gallonio, num sit aliquis cui eo
  </p>
  <p>
   homine esset opus salvo. “Quamobrem?” rogat. “Quia, inquam, insanit.”
  </p>
  <p>
   276 Anticlaudianus 1.92. “Syrenes nemorum, cithariste veris.”
  </p>
  <p>
   277 Cf. Cic. Brut. XXIII.93: “dein cum otiosus stilum prehenderat motusque omnis animi tamquam ventus
  </p>
  <p>
   hominem defecerat, flaccescebat oratio.”

  <p>
   Nec mora; ad fontem ibi large manantem accedimus. Ubi oppressi sumus a
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopho illo, qui in prandio mulieres fere omnes impudicitia notaverat. Quo
  </p>
  <p>
   perspecto, innuit nobis Gallonius, ut regrederemur atque odium illud effugeremus. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   antevertit consilium nostrum philosophi sagacitas; nam me prehensum pallio retinuit et:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Quo, inquit, properas? Mane, obsecro, nam cupio perpetuum amicitiae foedus tecum
  </p>
  <p>
   inire, quem hodie ex disputatione habita non alienum a litteris comperi.” Arreptaque mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   manu: “Cum noveris, inquit, nos cunctis hominibus doctis antepones. Nam si juratus
  </p>
  <p>
   meliorem rhetorem vel doctiorem philosophum quaereres, praeter me non alium
  </p>
  <p>
   adduceres. Ita ego sum magister solus praeter ceteros. Etenim non item discipulos
  </p>
  <p>
   doceo, ut alii doctores faciunt, qui eos quos erudiunt consenescere in scholis jubent;
  </p>
  <p>
   sed longe breviore methodo ac via ad summum philosophiae culmen adduco. Ego
  </p>
  <p>
   primus hanc viam inveni et, si non piget calcare, me tibi in ea comitem ducemque
  </p>
  <p>
   profiteor. Sed non prius tibi dabitur hinc abeundi potestas, quam aliquod ingenii mei
  </p>
  <p>
   specimen capias. Et, quoniam cum historicis et oratoribus tibi magis rem esse
  </p>
  <p>
   animadverti quam cum alterius artis magistris, Rhetoricae totius formam in tabulis
  </p>
  <p>
   expressam dabo, quibus in memoria tanquam in pariete defixis, unico aspectu omnia
  </p>
  <p>
   sese offerent quae in ea arte traduntur.” “Parce sodes,278 inquit Gallonius; ne te
  </p>
  <p>
   defatiges, neque praeterquam quas ipse calor molestias habet, adjicias.” “Nunquam
  </p>
  <p>
   perficies, ait ille, quin hujus studiis consulam hodie.” Ego, quoniam aliter fieri non
  </p>
  <p>
   poterat, porrecto jugulo, me illi conficiendum trado. Ergo incipit: “In prima tabula
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   inventione atque doctrina. Inventio est notatio282 et animadversio naturae. Quae natura
  </p>
  <p>
   nihil est aliud nisi innata ingenii aptitudo ad dicendum. Doctrina vero artem et
  </p>
  <p>
   exercitationem includit. Et est ars praeceptio methodum dicendi praestan. Exercitatio,

   descripto concluditur: videlicet demonstrativo, judiciali, ac deliberativo.286
  </p>
  <p>
   279 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 35) refers to Quint. Inst. 2.15.16: “Aristoteles cum dixit vim esse
  </p>
  <p>
   videndi quid in quaque re possit esse persuasibile.”
  </p>
  <p>
   280 Cic. Inv. rhet. I.V.6: “Officium autem eius facultatis videtur esse dicere apposite ad persuasionem”;
  </p>
  <p>
   Cic. De or. I.XXXI.138: “primum oratoris officium esse dicere ad persuadendum accommodate.”
  </p>
  <p>
   281 Cicero defines causes thus: “The particular [question] is what the Greeks call ὑπόθεσις (hypothesis),
  </p>
  <p>
   and we call cause or case” (Top. XXI.79); Likewise Quintillian (Inst. 3.5.7): “Definite questions involve
  </p>
  <p>
   facts, persons, time and the like. The Greeks call them hypotheses, while we call them causes”; L&amp;S
  </p>
  <p>
   provides the following definition: “that which lies at the basis of a rhetorical representation, matter,
  </p>
  <p>
   subject, ὑπόθεσις,” and cites Cic. Top. XXI.79 (see above); Cic. Inv. rhet. I.VI.8; ibid. Rhet. Her. I.XI.18;
  </p>
  <p>
   and Quint. Inst. 3.5.7 (see above).
  </p>
  <p>
   282 Rhet. Her. IV.L.63: “Notatio est cum alicuius natura certis describitur signis, quae, sicuti notae quae,
  </p>
  <p>
   naturae sunt.”
  </p>
  <p>
   283 Rhet. Her. I.II.3: “Haec omnia tribus rebus adsequi poterimus: arte, imitatione, exercitatione. Ars est
  </p>
  <p>
   praeceptio, quae dat certam viam rationemque dicendi. Imitatio est qua impellimur, cum diligenti ratione,
  </p>
  <p>
   ut aliquorum similes in dicendo valeamus esse. Exercitatio est adsiduus usus consuetudoque dicendi.”
  </p>
  <p>
   284 Cic. Inv. rhet. I.V.7: “Materiam artis eam dicimus in qua omnis ars et ea facultas quae conficitur ex arte
  </p>
  <p>
   versatur. Ut si medicinae materiam dicamus morbos ac vulnera, quod in his omnis medicina versetur,
  </p>
  <p>
   item, quibus in rebus versatur ars et facultas oratoria, eas res materiam artis rhetoricae nominamus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   285 Quint. Inst. 5.10.104: “Hoc genus argumentum sane dicamus ex circumstantia, quia περίστασιν dicere
  </p>
  <p>
   aliter non possumus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   286 Rhet. Her. I.II.2: “Tria genera sunt causarum quae recipere debet orator: demonstrativum,
  </p>
  <p>
   deliberativum, iudiciale. Demonstrativum est quod tribuitur in alicuius certae personae laudem vel
  </p>
  <p>
   vituperationem. Deliberativum est in consultatione, quod habet in se suasionem et dissuasionem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Iudiciale est quod positum est in controversia, et quod habet accusationem aut petitionem cum
  </p>
  <p>
   defensione.” See also Cic. Inv. rhet. I.V.7. The three types of cases were formally established by Aristotle
  </p>
  <p>
   in Rhetoric 1358b 7.
  </p>
  <p>
   164
  </p>
  <p>
   Demonstrativum rei laudem vel vituperationem continet; nempe amplificationem rerum
  </p>
  <p>
   bonarum vel malarum,287 quas rei inesse contendimus. Ejus finis est honestas vel
  </p>
  <p>
   turpitudo.288 Scopus, delectatio auditorum; tempus, praesens. Judiciale positum est in
  </p>
  <p>
   controversia atque habet in se intentionem cum defensione. Ejus finis est justum et
  </p>
  <p>
   injustum. Scopus vel modus, judicis clementia aut saevitia; tempus, praeteritum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Praeterea judicia omnia vel sunt criminis, vel controversiae. Criminis oratio duplex:
  </p>
  <p>
   categoria, quae crimen objicit; apologia, quae diluit. Controversiae itidem oratio duplex:
  </p>
  <p>
   petitio, qua aliquid postulatur; recusatio, qua deberi negatur. Sequitur genus
  </p>
  <p>
   deliberativum, quod positum in consultatione habet in se dictionem sententiae. Ejus finis
  </p>
  <p>
   est utile et inutile; scopus, deliberantis spes, metus; tempus, futurum. Partes, suasio,
  </p>
  <p>
   quae quid faciendum sit docet; et recusatio, quae contrarium defendit. Haec igitur est
  </p>
  <p>
   prima tabula, in qua Rhetorices constitutio non minus ad veritatem exprimitur, quam si
  </p>
  <p>
   esset Apellis vel Zeuxidis manu depicta. Convertite nunc animum ad alteram tabulam,
  </p>
  <p>
   quae partes et officia oratoris pene oculis subjicit.” Tum vero victa est Gallonii patientia

   ac: “Mane, inquit, cogito te perendie ad coenam invitare. Ibi ociosius cupio tabulas,
  </p>
  <p>
   quas narras, aspicere. Nam earum pulchritudo ad contemplandum non brevem aliquam
  </p>
  <p>
   moram, sed longum tempus efflagitat; quod dies jam plane demortuus denegat, et tu
  </p>
  <p>
   scis occupationes meas.” Philosophus, audito coenae nomine, frontem expromsit
  </p>
  <p>
   287 Aldus Manutius provides a useful explanation of this concept in his commentary on the Ad Herennium:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Una [pars] est laus, quae rerum bonarum, quas in aliqua persona orator esse dicit, continet
  </p>
  <p>
   amplificationem. Altera [pars] vituperatio, quae rerum malarum, cum certae personae designatione,
  </p>
  <p>
   amplificationem habet” (“In IV libros rhetoricorum ad C. Herennium Aldi Manutii commentaries” in M.T.

   Ciceronis (vel incerti auctoris) Rhetoricorum ad C. Herennium libri quatuor (Neapoli: Porcelli, 1777): 443).
  </p>
  <p>
   288 Rhet. Her. II.IV.12: “aliae sunt cuiusque generis diversae praeceptiones. Aliud enim laus, aliud
  </p>
  <p>
   vituperatio, aliud sententiae dictio, aliud accusatio aut recusatio conficere debet. In iudiciis quid aequum
  </p>
  <p>
   sit quaeritur, in demonstrationibus quid honestum, in deliberationibus, ut nos arbitramur, quid honestum
  </p>
  <p>
   sit et quid utile.”

  <p>
   hilarique voce: “Ego quoque, ait, idem censeo. Ego domi tuae magno istius cum lucro,
  </p>
  <p>
   ingenii mei divitias proferam, atque eadem opera, quae dixi quaeque dicturus sum,
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquot in chartulis velut in tabulis descripta proponam. Et si mihi iste ad discendum se

   tradiderit unico fere mense, Logicae, Physicae, Metaphysicaeque notitiam non naevo

  <p>
   aliquo aut crepundiis, sed corpore omni289 percipiet. Earum ille imagines pluribus in
  </p>
  <p>
   tabulis descriptas si cubiculi sui parietibus affixerit, quasi pinacothecam quandam
  </p>
  <p>
   instruxerit, longe iis elegantiorem in quibus Polyclaeti,290 Zeuxidis, Protogenis, et
  </p>
  <p>
   Parrhasii manus adorantur.” Ego, collaudata illius doctrina, Gallonium abeuntem
  </p>
  <p>
   subsequor. Qui inquit: “Nisi de coena mentio esset injecta, nunquam hodie hirudo291 ista
  </p>
  <p>
   nos dimisisset. Sed vidistine, obsecro, hominem magis ineptum, qui quocumque in loco
  </p>
  <p>
   quoscumque inter homines libitum sit, de rebus gravissimis argutissime disputet?” Ego
  </p>
  <p>
   tot delirantium somniis enectus: “Quaeso, inquam, Galloni, amoveamus nos hinc ocius,
  </p>
  <p>
   ne alius quispiam stultus odio suo nos plane conficiat. Nam diis iratis nostris huc
  </p>
  <p>
   venimus.” “Tace sis, inepte, inquit Gallonius, tanquam si Romae hujus generis stultorum
  </p>
  <p>
   multo majorem numerum invenire non liceat!” “Vera dicis, inquam; neque aliud
  </p>
  <p>
   quidquam habeo quod dicam, nisi quod nemo sine vitiis nascitur, ac cum perfectis non
  </p>
  <p>
   vivitur.” Haec atque alia commemorantes, domum nos tandem recepimus. Ubi eum

   servum, quem Gallonius in macellum praemiserat, non solum obsonatu rediisse, verum

  </p>
  <p>
   290 Both the 1637 and the 1645 editions read “Polydaeti,” which is most likely a typesetting error (where
  </p>
  <p>
   the typesetter read the “cl” in the manuscript as a “d”). Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 37 reads: “Legendum
  </p>

   procul dubio: ‘Polycleti.’”

   291 hirudo: bloodsucker or leech. The most famous reference to a hirudo in ancient Roman literature
  </p>
  <p>
   appears as the very last word of Hor. Ars. P.; see l. 475-6: “quem uero arripuit, tenet occiditque legendo, /
  </p>
  <p>
   non missura cutem nisi plena cruoris hirudo.”

   Liber V
  </p>
  <p>
   Postridie mane, cum necessitas nulla urgeret mature surgendi, in multam lucem
  </p>
  <p>
   somnum produximus. Sed cum diei tempus atque hirae292 latrantes cibum exposcerent,
  </p>
  <p>
   subuculam, thoracem, femoralia ac tibialia poposcimus. Quibus indutis: “Cogito, inquit
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius, postquam meus dynasta a mensa surrexerit, ducere vos in buleuterium.
  </p>
  <p>
   Delectabit enim signa pulcherrima ex aere, vel marmore, tabulas pictas summorum
  </p>
  <p>
   artificum manu confectas aspicere. Nam commune hoc ad senatus habendos, ad
  </p>
  <p>
   magistratus creandos alendosque aedes amplissimas habet, multis ejusmodi rebus
  </p>
  <p>
   refertas. Ibi Poliarchi (id enim magistratui illi nomen est) causas eorum cognoscunt ac
  </p>
  <p>
   judicant qui in id forum conveniunt. Nam olim, antequam haec Respublica in potestate
  </p>
  <p>
   ac moderatione dynastarum verteretur,293 ad Populi arbitrium judiciumque summa
  </p>
  <p>
   omnium rerum consiliorumque redibat294; in eo summa potestas, summa auctoritas erat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed post attritas civilibus discordiis opes, cum se dynastis permisisset, ne omnino
  </p>
  <p>
   spoliatus imperio videretur, rerum quarundam administrationem sibi retinuit. Videlicet
  </p>
  <p>
   dat operam, ut ab emptionibus ac venditionibus, eduliorum praesertim, fraudes
  </p>
  <p>
   amoveantur; nimirum ut eadem ad mensuram pondusve respondeant. Itaque Poliarchi
  </p>
  <p>
   singulis fere rebus precia constituunt; numerum vel pondus assignant; et, si quod est
  </p>
  <p>
   admissum facinus, si res pluris vendita, si sit ejus ponderi, videlicet assi, uncia vel

   292 The 1637 edition reads “hiri.”

  <p>
   sextans ereptus, iidem discernunt, multas poenasque constituunt.295 Atqui ad

  <p>
   perquirendas fraudes certos quosdam constitutos habent, qui quotidie mane lanienas,
  </p>
  <p>
   thermopolia, ac fora circumeunt; et quoscunque carnes, vina, pisces, succidiam vel quid
  </p>
  <p>
   ejusmodi ferentes offendunt, sistunt; rogant unde emerint, quanti; ac statera, quam ad
  </p>
  <p>
   eum usum ferunt, examinant vel hemina metiuntur. Ac si res emptas ad mensuram
  </p>
  <p>
   pondusve non respondere comperiunt, venditorem cogunt id quod fraudaverit reddere;
  </p>
  <p>
   ejusque nomen ad Poliarchos deferunt, qui, habita deferentibus fide, absque alia
  </p>
  <p>
   probatione, reum vel pecunia multant, vel aliqua corporis poena coercent. Quamobrem
  </p>
  <p>
   olim id muneris optimo cuique locupletissimoque dabatur, quo ejus testimonio credi
  </p>
  <p>
   posset, neque esset aliqua acceptae pecuniae suspicio. Sed ita nunc mos viget, ut fere
  </p>
  <p>
   egentissimus quisque ab iis, qui summam habent auctoritatem in hac Republica, in
  </p>
  <p>
   hunc locum attrahatur. Quo fit ut fures manifestarii, fractis legum ac judiciorum laqueis,
  </p>
  <p>
   quibus obstricti tenentur, parva saepe pecunia meritas poenas effugiant.” Tum ego:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Nihil est, O Galloni, (ut etiam pro Paulo respondeam) quod malimus spectare, quam
  </p>
  <p>
   buleuterium istud quod loqueris.” “Mox, inquit ille, faciam cupiditati vestrae satis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eamus.” Sed vix domo pedem efferimus, cum aspicimus honesta facie atque eleganti
  </p>
  <p>
   vestitu hominem domi cujusdam fores impellere. Cui mulier de fenestra: “Quis, inquit,
  </p>
  <p>
   has fores pepulit?” “Ego sum,” respondet; “aperite aliquis, si vultis.” Tum illa:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Opportune advenis, here; non habemus domi olus in prandium. Eme, nisi molestum
  </p>
  <p>
   est, obolo.” At ille: “Recte admones. Ego afferam. Facite ut paratum sit prandium cum
  </p>
  <p>
   venero.” “Fiet, here, inquit illa; i ergo cum diis benevolentibus.” “Quam lepide, inquit
  </p>
  <p>
   295 Caes. BGall. VI.13: “Nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt, et, si quod est
  </p>
  <p>
   admissum facinus, si caedes facta, si de hereditate, de finibus controversia est, idem decernunt, praemia
  </p>
  <p>
   poenasque constituunt.”
  </p>
  <p>
   168
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius, ancilla herum ab aedibus arcuit! Sed, ni piget hic paulum consistere, ludos
  </p>
  <p>
   aspicietis longe pulcherrimos. Habitat in his aedibus mulier formosa et aetate integra,296
  </p>
  <p>
   uxor ejus qui olus missus est emere. Haec, conscio marito, cum publicano locuplete
  </p>
  <p>
   rem habet. Sed quo eum faciat arietem Phryxi, et usque ad vivam cutem auro
  </p>
  <p>
   detondeat,297 persuasit ipsi se clam viro morigeram esse. Nam: “Si paululum, inquit, hoc
  </p>
  <p>
   illi suboleat, illico omnes perimus. Tibi certe illud eveniat, quod moechis solet; quia ille
  </p>
  <p>
   est homo iracundus, violentus, ferus.” Sed, revera, nulla est ovis tam placida quam ille
  </p>
  <p>
   est hircus, neque qui magis in uxoris potestate versetur. Attamen, quo metui videatur,
  </p>
  <p>
   placuit inter ipsos ut, si domum rediens, signo dato, intus esse moechum accipiat,
  </p>
  <p>
   simulatione aliqua a foribus tantisper abscedat, dum sese foras ille proripiat.” Vix ea
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius dixerat, cum ecce tibi foris crepuit ac moechum evomuit. “Dixin? inquit
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius; quid vobis videtur? At, si esset ocium manendi hic, nec alio vocarer, ut scitis,
  </p>
  <p>
   videretis advolantes huc bajulos cum sportis, coctum olido hirco prandium ferentes. Et
  </p>
  <p>
   sane ferax est haec tellus ejusmodi hominum. Nec mirum si eorum numerus fere in
  </p>
  <p>
   immensum excreverit. Nam est hic quaestus multo nunc uberrimus.298 Ille enim divitias,
  </p>
  <p>
   voluptates, honores parit, ille summorum hominum voluptates et studia conciliat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quamobrem, cui viro paulo liberaliori forma uxor evenit, si venalem eam habeat,
  </p>
  <p>
   manipulatim ad eum munigeruli, cum auro, veste, atque omnibus ad necessarium usum
  </p>
  <p>
   296 Ter. An. I.i.69-72: “Interea mulier quaedam abhinc triennium ex Andro commigravit huc viciniae . . .
  </p>
  <p>
   egregia forma atque aetate integra.”
  </p>
  <p>
   297 Plaut. Bacch. II.iii.241-2: “adibo hunc, quem quidem ego hodie faciam hic arietem / Phrixi, itaque
  </p>
  <p>
   tondebo auro usque ad vivam cutem.”
  </p>
  <p>
   298 Ter. Eun. II.ii.253: “Is quaestus nunc est multo uberrimus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   169
  </p>
  <p>
   accurrunt.299 Verum ideo haec ars prae ceteris pollet, quia, ut diximus, divitiae in honore
  </p>
  <p>
   sunt, paupertas probro ducitur; ocium ac luxus expetitur, labor ac modestia defugitur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed maritorum non unum est genus. Nam alii non dissimulanter et tacite, sed palam et
  </p>
  <p>
   aperte sunt improbi, et dummodo praesto sit, quod edant vel potent, suo arbitratu
  </p>
  <p>
   quotidie quid homines de se loquantur nauci non faciunt. Aliis paulo honestioribus
  </p>
  <p>
   quamvis idem propositum sit atque illis, nempe supra suas vires edere ac vestitui
  </p>
  <p>
   indulgere; attamen volunt existimari se id nescire quod sciunt, ac non videre quod
  </p>
  <p>
   vident. Sed, quo liberior moechis suas ad uxores aditus pateat, saepe rus itant;
  </p>
  <p>
   interdum menses integros patria domoque carent. Nec parum saepe contingit, ut ab
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquo ex potentioribus, qui paulo solutiore animo eorum uxores secum habere expetit,
  </p>
  <p>
   vel triremi vel oppido praeficiantur, ut illi non solum absint domo, cum navigant vel
  </p>
  <p>
   oppido praesunt, sed etiam libenter cum honore ac beneficio absint. Cum autem
  </p>
  <p>
   redeunt, hilare ac festive ab uxoribus excipiuntur, amplexibus implicantur; profert alia
  </p>
  <p>
   purpuram, aurum, torquem; ostendit alia conopea, stragulam vestem, eburneos lectos;
  </p>
  <p>
   aperit alia penum, cellam vinariam, granaria; frumentum ostentat, quod annum illum
  </p>
  <p>
   familiae sit satis; ac: ‘Vide, inquit, quid mihi mater, quid soror die natali meo tradiderit;
  </p>
  <p>
   quid mihi cognatus, affinis Quinquatriis, Compitalibus, Circensibus miserit.’ Boni viri
  </p>
  <p>
   credunt, gaudent, neque altius rem esse indagandam existimant. Ajunt etiam hanc tam
  </p>
  <p>
   ingentem meretricum multitudinem immanes illos sumtus peperisse qui nunc fiunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nonne vides, ut quaevis mulier ancillarum gregem secum ducat? Ut reginae in morem
  </p>
  <p>
   aurata ac vestita incedat? Imo cum unus aut alter sufficere earum sumtibus nequeat,
  </p>
  <p>
   299 Plaut. Pseud. I.ii.181: “maniplatim mihi munerigeruli facite ante aedis iam hic adsint. cur ego vestem,
  </p>
  <p>
   aurum atque ea quibus est vobis usus, prahibeo?”
  </p>
  <p>
   170
  </p>
  <p>
   plures amatores habere coguntur, atque inter eos partiri provinciam, hoc modo, ut ille in
  </p>
  <p>
   redimiculum praebeat: ille in collum, ille in crines, ille in cellam, ille in mensam.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Dum haec Gallonius narrat, aedes dynastae praeterimus imprudentes. Quod
  </p>
  <p>
   cum sentimus, regredimur rursum; intramus, commodum cum ille sterni sibi lectos ab
  </p>
  <p>
   architriclino jubet. Nec mora; Gallonius culinam intrat, dapes instruit, ornat, in mensam
  </p>
  <p>
   infert. Dynasta manus lavat, decumbit, prandet, pransus surgit seque in cubiculum
  </p>
  <p>
   abdit. Nos ad buleuterium300 recta contendimus ac Poliarchos offendimus, pro tribunali
  </p>
  <p>
   sedentes, juri dicundo301 operam dare. Circumstabant eos cetarii, caupones, coqui,
  </p>
  <p>
   fartores, cupedinarii, piscatores, aucupes.302 Horum tantus erat numerus ut, nisi cancelli
  </p>
  <p>
   interjecti defenderent, Poliarchos opprimerent. Odor qui ab illis teter afflabat locum
  </p>
  <p>
   implebat. Clamor item ab eisdem veniens concitato mari similis videbatur. Aliud alius
  </p>
  <p>
   orabat: “Mihi multam ne irroget. Me de reis eximat.” Clamabat alius: “Circumvenior,
  </p>
  <p>
   Poliarchi, nisi subvenitis.”303 Hic falsum indicium detulit, alius veterem cum Poliarcho
  </p>
  <p>
   amicitiam commemorabat. Ille nummos numerabat. Alius deum atque hominum fidem
  </p>
  <p>
   implorabat. Sed, cum satis disceptatum esset, quia dies ille dies erat Curiae,304 et
  </p>
  <p>
   300 buleuterium (from the Greek βουλευτήριον): senate house. A few lines down our protagonists depart
  </p>
  <p>
   the buleuterium to go to the curia, which also means senate house. I have chosen to refer to the general
  </p>
  <p>
   location they visit as the Capitoline and then to translate the former as “senate house” and the latter as
  </p>
  <p>
   “curia.”
  </p>
  <p>
   301 dicundo: archaic form of dicendo. The phrase “iure dicundo” is most well known in the context of the
  </p>
  <p>
   official office “Duoviri iure dicundo,” which was held by a pair of magistrates with the authority (or
  </p>
  <p>
   “iurisdictio”) to hear cases and pass judgement at a colonial or municipal level, without possessing the
  </p>
  <p>
   imperium of the Roman consul or praetor.
  </p>
  <p>
   302 Ter. Eun. II.ii.256-7: “Concurrunt laeti mihi obviam cupediarii omnes, Cetarii, lanii, coqui, fartores,
  </p>
  <p>
   piscatores.”
  </p>
  <p>
   303 Cic. Brut. LXXV.260: “circumvenior, judices, nisi subvenitis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   304 There is some disagreement as to whether the “dies curiae” mentioned in Cic. De or. I.VII.27 is a
  </p>
  <p>
   festival day (see L&amp;S) or simply a day that the senate is in session (see Cicero and Wilkins 1879); I
  </p>
  <p>
   translate it with the latter sense.
  </p>
  <p>
   171
  </p>
  <p>
   maximis de rebus atque gravissimis senatus erat habendus, conclamatum est:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Ilicet!”305 Hac praeconis voce cohibiti litigatores cuncti discedunt. Poliarchi descendunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   atque expectati veniunt in Curiam, quo jam buleutae (ita enim senatores vocant)
  </p>
  <p>
   frequentes convenerant. Illis ingredientibus, honorifice a cunctis assurgitur. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonium in primis cupido invaserat cognoscendi, quae tanta res eo die senatum extra
  </p>
  <p>
   ordinem cogeret. “Estne, inquit, hostis ad portas?” Cui responsum est, statuendum esse
  </p>
  <p>
   salsis muriaticis306 precium, quorum plenam navem biduo ante ad litus illud fortuna
  </p>
  <p>
   detulisset. Deinde, decernendum esse quot pira vel pruna vendenda sint obolo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Postquam igitur consedere buleutae, unus ex Poliarchis, qui aetate ceteris antecedebat,
  </p>
  <p>
   facit mentionem placere statui, si Patribus conscriptis videatur, ne salsamentorum libra
  </p>
  <p>
   carius nummo vendatur.307 Vilitatem eorum annonae declarat308; iniquitatem cetariorum
  </p>
  <p>
   exponit, qui ea, quae vilissime emerent, carissime venderent. Erat summa voluntas
  </p>
  <p>
   senatus, ut fieret senatusconsultum in Poliarchi verba. Itaque sententiae dicebantur,
  </p>
  <p>
   cum cetarii minoris asse et semisse salsamentorum libram emissent, placere non pluris
  </p>
  <p>
   305 ilicet: “let us go,” or “let us be gone.” IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. V n. 1) provides the following definition
  </p>
  <p>
   of “ilicet” in Ter. Phorm. I.iv.208 from Aelius Donatus’s Commentarius in Terentium: “Semper ‘ilicet’ finem
  </p>
  <p>
   rei significat, ut actum est. Sic iudices de concilio dimittebantur, suprema dicta cum praeco pronunciasset
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘ilicet’ quod significat ‘ire licet.’”
  </p>
  <p>
   306 Cf. Plaut. Poen. I.ii.239-40: “Soror, cogita, amabo, item nos perhiberi / quam si salsa muriatica esse
  </p>
  <p>
   autumantur.”
  </p>
  <p>
   307 Cic. Verr. II.II.XXXIX.95: “itaque in senatu continuo Cn. Lentulus et L. Gellius consules faciunt
  </p>
  <p>
   mentionem placere statui, si patribus conscriptis videretur, ne absentes homines in provinciis rei fierent
  </p>
  <p>
   rerum capitalium.”
  </p>
  <p>
   308 vilitas annonae: a fall in the price of wheat; cf. Cic. Leg. Man. XV.44: “tanta repente vilitas annonae ex
  </p>
  <p>
   summa inopia et caritate rei frumentariae.”
  </p>
  <p>
   172
  </p>
  <p>
   eam nummo licere ab ipsis revendi. Eo die transigi nihil potuit, quod et id temporis erat,
  </p>
  <p>
   et improbi illi invenerant homines, qui dicendo tempus consumerent.309
  </p>
  <p>
   Dimisso senatu, dum etiam tum Poliarchi inter se colloquuntur, accurrit unus, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   corrumpi prandium nunciat ac monet, ut venire accubitum properent; diem esse ad
  </p>
  <p>
   umbilicum dimidiatum mortuum.310 “Jus orat,311 inquit unus ex Poliarchis; eamus.” Et
  </p>
  <p>
   dum festinat, inspicit in turba Gallonium. Vocat atque: “Heus tu, inquit, hodie apud nos
  </p>
  <p>
   sis volo, et tecum isti quos ducis.” “Benigne” ait Gallonius, et simul occupationes varias
  </p>
  <p>
   excusat. Cui ille: “Nugas agis, respondet; nam si mutire audes, te pro potestate vinciri,
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>

   magnificeque constratum. Erat praeterea abacus seorsim exposita, nullum in ea vas

   Occurrunt servi complures simili vestitu, ex purpura auroque contecti (“pistes” eos

   grandior, quasi stomachans: “Mihi, inquit, siti fauces lippiunt; nimis diu siccus hic jaceo.

  <p>
   Ferte aliquis poculum, properate.” Accurrunt, afferunt. Quod ubi labris admovit: “Pape,

   inquit, non vinum hoc, sed Jovis est poculum. Unde, obsecro, prodiit? Quis illud deus ex
  </p>

  <p>
   non potius servandus, qui tam praeclaras potiones concinnat, quae prorogare vitam

   321 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. V n. 4) refers to a passage from a 1533 Latin translation by Hadrianus Chilius
  </p>
  <p>
   of Ar. Plut. 594-597: “Licet ex Hecate hoc rogites, potiusne sit esurias, an abundes. / Siquidem haec
  </p>
  <p>
   pauperibus singlis mensibus edicit, ut opulenti / Coenam apponant, prius autem illi abripiant quam isti
  </p>
  <p>
   apposuere.” For more information about Chilius’s Latin translation, IJsewijn refers to Van Kerchove 1974.
  </p>
  <p>
   IJsewijn makes the point that Plutus was translated more than once into Latin and that Rossi was
  </p>
  <p>
   perhaps familar with a 1594 translation titled Ἀριστοφανους Πλουτος. Aristophanis Plutus (Ex officina H.

  <p>
   Saluiani: Apud I. I. Carlinum, &amp; A. Pacem: Neapoli).

  </p>
  <p>
   illi lagenas invadunt, rapiunt, in sese invergunt, vel potius in barathrum fundunt. Illis e
  </p>
  <p>
   conspectu sublatis, rogavit Iberus ille num caupo, qui tam bonum vinum dedisset,
  </p>
  <p>
   saepius delinqueret. “Saepissime, inquiunt Poliarchi. Sed non magis accipiter vel milvus
  </p>
  <p>
   rete, in quo induit sese, disrumpit, quam iste judicia omnia legesve perfringit. Nec, si
  </p>
  <p>
   maxime condemnare eum placeat, id nobis per dynastas licet, quorum magnam partem
  </p>
  <p>
   munere aliquo sibi devinxit. Nam aliis cellam vinariam instruit, aliis praebet quotidie
  </p>
  <p>
   quod potent. Itaque, cum est opus, pro illius incolumitate atque salute, non secus ac pro
  </p>
  <p>
   ipsorum gloria, fortunis, ac fama decertant. Sed ejus improbitas nobis quoque usui est.
  </p>
  <p>
   Semper enim aliquid ab eo corradimus, vel pecuniam, vel vinum, vel delicatum saltem
  </p>
  <p>
   obsonium.” Erat Graeculus quidam in illis, naufragio itidem ut nos illuc appulsus, qui,
  </p>
  <p>
   cum vinum ebibisset, reliquum sic e poculo ejiciebat ut id resonaret.323 Quod Iberus
  </p>
  <p>
   ferens indigne: “Videturne tibi, inquit, hoc vinum dignum quod ejiciatur? Tum ego ad
  </p>
  <p>
   elidendum in pavimentis sonum ex vino relinquerem,324 cum lora aliqua vel vappa mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   esset ingratiis potanda; at suavissimi hujus vini ne guttam quidem patiar deperire.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Atque una opera ingentem pateram implet, eamque vini meri, ita ut matre erat natum,
  </p>
  <p>
   exhaurit; qua epota, quidquid eidem villi adhaeserat, coepit lingua delingere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quamobrem totum illud convivium redundavit hilaritate et joco. Quo confecto, accedit

  <p>
   quod uncti essent, a muribus fuisse corrosos. Proinde argentum enumerent, quo novos

  <p>
   decernere ut pecunia ex aerario depromatur, non ad ipsos sed ad senatum universum
  </p>
  <p>
   spectare. Se tamen honoris ipsius gratia senatum quamprimum convocaturos atque

  <p>
   operam daturos, ut rei tam necessariae quanta maxima potest celeritate obviam eatur.
  </p>
  <p>
   His actis, suum quisque in cubiculum requietis causa se contulit. Nos ad tabulas
  </p>
  <p>
   pictas et signa pulcherrima aspicienda oculos animumque convertimus; et quia nulla
  </p>
  <p>
   aspiciendi satietas erat, quatuor fere horas in eorum contemplatione consumpsimus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed, inclinato in vesperam die, discessimus. Inter eundum sciscitamur a Gallonio, cur
  </p>
  <p>
   invitatus ad prandium tam opiparum non continuo accurrisset, sed vi ac minis prope
  </p>
  <p>
   attrahi maluisset. “Quia, inquit, pudebat me conspici cum talibus viris accumbere.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Quid, aio, nonne honestus est ille honoris locus?” “Est, inquit, honestus, sed interdum
  </p>
  <p>
   non sunt honesti qui in eum ascendunt. Nam hodie statuarii, pictores, sarcinatores ac, si
  </p>
  <p>
   diis placet, mediastini gratia vel precio ereptum eum adveniunt. Quamobrem ex
  </p>
  <p>
   nobilibus, praeter paucos qui bonis elaverunt,325 vix quisquam invenitur qui magistratum
  </p>
  <p>
   hunc petat. Imo saepe multi ultro oblatum sibi recusant.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Inter haec Aridus academicus nobis occurrit. Consistimus. Rogat ille Gallonium,
  </p>
  <p>
   unde veniat; quo tendat. Respondet: “Modo ex buleuterio discessimus.” “Quid, ait,

   negotii tibi fuit in buleuterio? Venistine eo advocatus cuiquam, vel cauponi vel

  </p>
  <p>
   Poliarcho, Megadori326 filio, ejus qui fullonicam fecit.” “Audio, inquit, sed bene vobis fuit
  </p>
  <p>
   vino ac lepidis victibus?” “Sic, ait Gallonius, ut mihi nunquam in vita fuerit melius.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Gaudeo, inquit Aridus, si quid tibi evenit boni.” “Sed tu, quo te agis?” ait Gallonius.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Nescio, inquit Aridus, neque quo eam, neque quid agam. Vix potui me divellere a
  </p>
  <p>
   quodam, qui lateri meo inhaeserat, nec me volebat amittere. Exibam ex delubro
  </p>
  <p>
   Apollinis, quo frequenter orandi causa venio; atque fit mihi obviam quidam senex bene
  </p>
  <p>
   vestitus, ac salvere me jubet; salutanti mutuam salutationem reddo. At ille: ‘Quamvis
  </p>

   antehac, inquit, non sis usus amicitia mea, nec fortasse me noveris; attamen jampridem
  </p>
  <p>
   te ob tuas virtutes colo, et amicum habere expeto.’ Ego gratias ago, neque in hac mea
  </p>
  <p>
   mediocritate ingenii fortunaeque quidquam esse affirmo, quod ille miretur atque
  </p>
  <p>
   suspiciat; neque tamen audebam interrogare quis esset. At ille: ‘Si me noveris, inquit,
  </p>
  <p>
   noveris sane hominem probum, et in primis cupidum existimationis bonae. Non enim

  <p>
   invenies mei loci atque ordinis alterum, boni nominis aeque studiosum, quique uxorem

  </p>
  <p>
   prius pecuniam omnem, quam vel levem aliquam in existimationem meam labem
  </p>
  <p>
   admittam.327 Nam quid mihi opus est vita, quid opibus et divitiis, parte aliqua
  </p>
  <p>
   existimationis amissa? Praeterea octavo quoque die puro me flumine abluo, et diis

   326 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. V n. 6) rightly points out that the 1637 and 1645 editions incorrectly have
  </p>
  <p>
   “Megadoris” as the genitive form of the name Megadorus. IJsewijn places square brackets around the
  </p>
  <p>
   final “s” to highlight the error. I silently corrected it to “Megadori.”

   luculentus est atque festivus. In ludo gladiatorio, in arte equitandi neminem metuit una

  <p>
   aetate qui sit. Praeterea cantat quod Apollo etiam invideat.’ Tum ego: ‘Hui, inquam,

  <p>
   verisimile est, ita scite fidibus canit, ita ad fidium cantum suavissimam vocem

   accommodat, ut Iovem etiam possit de caelo deducere. Quamobrem tanti ad eam
  </p>
  <p>
   audiendam principum virorum concursus fiunt, ut, cum eorum amplitudinem et numerum
  </p>
  <p>
   domus mea non caperet, fuerit mihi necesse aedes longe laxiores in celeberrima urbis

   parte conducere; atque heri minas octo pro semestris habitationis mercede persolvi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nec mirum, si omnes ita avidas ad eam aures afferant. Jam pridem non est audita.
  </p>
  <p>
   Modo enim ab Anthimo rege revenimus, qui nos ad nuptias sororis suae maximis
  </p>
  <p>
   praemiis accitos, menses apud se continuos octo detinuit. Hanc diligo, quae mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   morigera est ac deos metuit; hanc curo unam, quae me curat nitidiuscule, vestit, ornat.

   Sed quo pacto res ipsius, quae paupercula est, tot sumptus sufferat, non esse arbitror
  </p>

   meretricis patrem; ac pudore supra quam dici potest metuque correptus, ne conspicerer

   atque illam infamiam effugi.” “En vobis, inquit Gallonius, alterum genus hircorum, quod
  </p>
  <p>
   eram oblitus, id cum sit turpissimum, simulatione honestatis ac sanctimoniae opinioni
  </p>
  <p>
   hominum se commendare nititur. Sed istius impudentia eo est intolerabilior, quod rei
  </p>
  <p>
   apertissimae clarissimaeque tenebras offundere conatur, ac contendere mero meridie
  </p>
  <p>
   tenebras esse.328 Nam quod ait, filiam suam a rege Anthimo accersitam ad nuptias,
  </p>
  <p>
   aperte mentitur. Illuc enim perducta est ab adolescente, qui eam usurariam habet. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   ob flagitia et turbas quas effecit, ejus regni finibus quantum est, pulsa se recepit in

   “Sed de his hactenus, inquit Aridus. Nihilne allatum est ad vos de fuga Lyconis

   pecuniae syngraphas afferebant, varias occupationes excusare, atque ut postridie
  </p>
  <p>
   reverterentur orare. Quamobrem expletus pecunia, concubia nocte, fugam arripuit, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   potius occultavit se in aedibus alicujus potentis, cujus praesidio septus pecunias, quas

   329 I have added a question mark here that is not present in the 1637 and 1645 editions, so this sentence
  </p>
  <p>
   makes more sense in context.
  </p>
  <p>
   330 The verb here is third person plural: “congesserant.” Because the subject of this story is the cloth
  </p>
  <p>
   merchant (pannarius), I assume in my translation that the third person plural subject is his businesses,
  </p>
  <p>
   implied earlier in the “everything (i.e., his business interests) proceeded according to plan.”

   merchant.

  <p>
   Harpax experrectus, dum etiam tum pandiculans oscitatur,338 fit ut chartam illam sibi ad
  </p>
  <p>
   caput appositam naso diverberet. Sumptam in manus inspicit, legit, ac prae gaudio:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Sum dives,’ exclamat. Ac sororis filio, qui ad eam vocem accurrerat, ‘Macte, inquit,
  </p>
  <p>
   virtute juvenis; pulchre, strenue, lepide! Nunc noster es; laudo; dignus es pro hac insigni
  </p>
  <p>
   tua in avunculum pietate, qui meis facultatibus pariter mecum utaris, aut etiam amplius.’
  </p>
  <p>
   Nec mora; tabernam vestiariam, ut mos est decoctorum, occludit, ac pro decoctore se
  </p>
  <p>
   gerit. Spargitur interea rumor, Harpacem decoxisse. Mirum, novum, incredibile omnibus
  </p>
  <p>
   videri eum, qui quatuor horas ante opibus et existimatione valuisset, puncto temporis
  </p>
  <p>
   his omnibus eversum concidisse. At creditores non sibi desunt; ad Praetorem accurrunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rem narrant. Ut in carcerem detrudatur orant, impetrant. Lictores domum Harpacis
  </p>
  <p>
   advolant, irruunt, impetum in eum faciunt, vincula injiciunt. Ille quaestoris diploma
  </p>
  <p>
   lictoribus in os objicit, impetum adimit, audaciam eripit, atque, ultro derisos, una cum
  </p>
  <p>
   creditoribus in malam rem ire compellit. Creditores, ubi hanc rem esse occisam vident,
  </p>
  <p>
   universi convenient; queruntur, consultant, quid optimum factu sit quaerunt.339 Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   omnia consilia frigent; quid agant non inveniunt. Sed dum ita aestuant, procedit in
  </p>
  <p>
   medium unus qui erat in consilio, clam ab isto summissus, quique magnam pecuniae
  </p>
  <p>
   rationem se cum eo habere assimulabat; ac: ‘Si licet, inquit, loqui quod sentio, ego
  </p>
  <p>
   darem operam, ut, si fieri posset, ad aliquam cum eo pactionem conditionemque
  </p>
  <p>
   venirem. Nam quamvis multa apud eum bona reperiantur, attamen magnam eorum
  </p>
  <p>
   partem, dotis nomine, sibi mater vendicat, magnam etiam sororis filius, quorum singuli
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   tum magnitudine pecuniae, tum temporis intervallo unicuique nostrum antecedunt.’
  </p>
  <p>
   Inventus est nemo, qui non cum eo transigendum putaret. Satius enim esse ajebant,
  </p>
  <p>
   partem aliquam crediti quam totum amittere. Et simul isti negocium dant, ut hominem
  </p>
  <p>
   adeat, causam creditorum suscipiat, et quam minimo potest detrimento rem cum eo
  </p>
  <p>
   decidat. Postridie revertitur; vix Harpacem eo a se perductum narrat, ut singulis
  </p>
  <p>
   creditoribus intra biennium dimidium ejus, quod debet, exolvat. Illud a se extortum et
  </p>
  <p>
   quidem summa cum vi, ut ejus, quod promitteret, praedes matrem ac sororis filium
  </p>
  <p>
   daret. Clamant omnes: ‘Audaciam! Impudentiam! Quid enim excogitari impudentius
  </p>
  <p>
   potest, quam velle dimidiam crediti partem sibi remitti, et ad id, quod superest,
  </p>
  <p>
   enumerandum biennium exposcere?’ Tum ille qui retulerat: ‘Agite, inquit, ut lubet. Matris
  </p>
  <p>
   ac sororis filii creditum totas ejus facultates exhaurit sane. Quod ad me attinet, mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   certum ac deliberatum est cum illo transigere.’ At miseri creditores, postquam ira
  </p>
  <p>
   deferbuit, inter sacrum saxumque se positos esse intelligentes,340 statuunt, de communi
  </p>
  <p>
   sententia, fortunae cedere, atque id quod dabatur accipere. Decretum fit in verba illius
  </p>
  <p>
   qui rem proposuerat; ac scribendo ad unum omnes intersunt. Harpax, tanta recente
  </p>
  <p>
   pecunia locupletatus, ad clivum Jani, amoeno atque ab arbitris remoto loco, aedes
  </p>
  <p>
   magnificas, ac viridarium illis adjunctum, magna mercede conducit; rhedam et familiam
  </p>
  <p>
   comparat; ornat quotidie laute magnificeque convivium; et, quo aliqua se simulatione
  </p>
  <p>
   existimationi hominum vindicet, ut non suo sed fortunae vitio naufragium bonorum

  </p>
  <p>
   Haec cum Aridus dixisset, silentium est consecutum. Sed paulo post Gallonius,
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam ab aliquo somno excitatus, sive dolore naufragae, vel potius pessundatae
  </p>
  <p>
   pecuniae percussus, sive iracundia elatus: “Fures, inquit, isti et praedones manifestarii,
  </p>
  <p>
   si meo arbitratu liceat, omnes pendeant.342 Sed quonam meo fato fieri dicam, ut nemo
  </p>
  <p>
   abhinc triennium conturbaverit, quin meas etiam fortunas perturbaverit?343 Nonne
  </p>
  <p>
   Pleusides ille, qui ante duos annos argentariam fecit, mihi etiam imposuit? Nam minas
  </p>
  <p>
   quatuor abstulit.” “At me non fefellit, inquit Aridus. Nam faciem cum aspiceres, nonne
  </p>
  <p>
   ipsum caput et supercilia olere crucem et clamitare furcas videbantur?” “At fecit
  </p>
  <p>
   eleganter,” excepit Gallonius; “nam priusquam pecunias cujusquam attingeret, clam
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes in publicas tabulas referendum curavit, nihil sibi esse in terris, ubi in suo pedem
  </p>
  <p>
   poneret,344 sed ad patruum amitamque quae sua putarentur omnia spectare. Tum
  </p>
  <p>
   coepit ab omnibus pecunias accipere, permutare. Postremo, refertus pecunia, in
  </p>
  <p>
   proximum huic insulae regnum, ad expugnandas aliorum pecunias, castra commovit.

  <p>
   185
  </p>
  <p>
   cur non etiam, inquit Aridus, huic narras Septimi Pleusippi furtum, omnium quae
  </p>
  <p>
   memoravimus improbissimum? Fortasse quia immunis ab eo discesseris, neque una
  </p>
  <p>
   cum aliis fueris detonsus.” “Non aedepol, Gallonius ait, in mentem venerat. Nam tantus
  </p>
  <p>
   est istorum furum numerus, ut non sit mirum, si mihi nonneminem eorum multitudo
  </p>
  <p>
   subducat. Sed quaeso, narra tu illi. Ira enim, qua efferor, paene mihi mentem
  </p>
  <p>
   extorquet.” Tum Aridus: “Libenter, inquit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hic Septimus, quem dicimus, argentariam quam multos annos fecerat, ex
  </p>
  <p>
   improviso dissolvit; atque imperat filio, quem maliciose emancipaverat, ut novam
  </p>
  <p>
   argentariam instituat; et pecunias quas in nominibus habebat,345 quae erant maximae
  </p>
  <p>
   ac debebantur ab iis qui tunc solvendo non erant,346 a se coëmat. Ille, uti erat
  </p>
  <p>
   imperatum, facit; ac novus trapezita pecunias ab omnibus accipit patrique deinceps, pro
  </p>
  <p>
   nominibus emptis, solutionis jure dinumerat. At pater, postquam illam rei familiaris
  </p>
  <p>
   lacunam explevisse347 visus est satis, filium appellat ac: ‘Satis, inquit, fili, officio nostro
  </p>
  <p>
   fecimus; satis rei familiari nostrae prospeximus; satis Lavernam propitiam habuimus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aegre enim ferebam prope conturbasse rem nostram, debitorum improbitate. Nunc
  </p>
  <p>
   autem, cum eam in suam rationem revertisse jam videam, aequum arbitror, ut pecuniis
  </p>
  <p>
   miserorum innocentium parcamus. Nam, quemadmodum eos laudo qui dant operam rei
  </p>
  <p>
   suae, etiam cum alterius injuria; ita eos odi, qui cupiditate longius prodeunt, nec finem
  </p>
  <p>
   praedandi constituunt. Quamobrem facias, censeo, quod vulgus argentariorum solet, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   fuga rem solvas, hoc est, tantisper te in aliquam dynastae cujuspiam domum abdas,
  </p>
  <p>
   345 pecunias in nominibus habere: to have outstanding financial debts.
  </p>
  <p>
   346 solvendo esse: to be solvent, to be able to pay one’s debts.

   explerent.”

  </p>
  <p>
   dum ego creditoribus tuis aliqua decisione faciam satis. Neque minus meae partes
  </p>
  <p>
   erunt perficere, ut quamprimum tibi prodire in publicum liceat.’ Non moratur, sed statim
  </p>
  <p>
   summittit aliquot, qui spargant in vulgus filium decoxisse. Ad hanc vocem creditores
  </p>
  <p>
   accurrunt, Septimi domum obsident, bona describunt, tabulas obsignant.348 Fit obviam
  </p>
  <p>
   illis Septimus et: ‘Quid, inquit, domi meae vobis debetur?’ ‘Jam scies, inquiunt. Ambula
  </p>
  <p>
   in jus!’ Ille non invitus sequitur; venit ad praetorem; ostendit nihil eam rem ad se
  </p>
  <p>
   pertinere; filium emancipatum suas res ipsum agere. Ergo liber dimittitur; illi tristes
  </p>
  <p>
   abscedunt. Verum pater amantissimus, memor polliciti sui, de filio reducendo cum
  </p>
  <p>
   creditoribus agit. Quibus convocatis, ejusmodi conditionem affert, qua miseris crediti
  </p>
  <p>
   major pars deperibat. Illi qui eas pecunias in conclamatis haberent,349 pauxillulum quod
  </p>
  <p>
   deferebatur, tanquam de caelo demissum arripiunt. Verum felicitates fere nunquam
  </p>
  <p>
   solae contingunt, sed nexae copulataeque inter sese proveniunt. Nam qui ita fuerat felix
  </p>
  <p>
   in furando, obtinuit etiam, ut mala illa nomina quae filio divenderat, bona evaderent; ab
  </p>
  <p>
   eisque totum quod sibi debebatur exigeret; multumque deprecantibus nonnullis ac
  </p>
  <p>
   bonam copiam ejurantibus,350 ne unius quidem assis gratiam faceret. Unus adhuc
  </p>
  <p>
   scrupulus adolescentem cupidum existimationis bonae torquebat, videlicet infamia
  </p>
  <p>
   turpitudoque qua sese constrinxerat, ac: ‘Poterone posthac, ajebat, ora civium aspicere,
  </p>
  <p>
   aut populo huic os meum ostendere?’ Cui pater: ‘Tace, inquit, stulte; pecunia hic, non
  </p>
  <p>
   fama respicitur. Dum ea integra sit, si qua famae labes insedit, facile eluitur.’ Sed statim
  </p>
  <p>
   filius: ‘Arbitror, inquit, O pater, me rationem invenisse recuperandae existimationis
  </p>
  <p>
   348 tabulas obsignare: to seal up the records; cf. Cic. Verr. II.IV.LXVI.149: “hic ego postulare coepi ut mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   tabulas obsignare ac deportare liceret.”

   existimatione ac nomine, qui festis diebus in concionibus, quas habet ad populum,
  </p>
  <p>
   luxuriam et avaritiam nostrorum hominum insectatur; eum omnes tanquam de caelo
  </p>
  <p>
   delapsum intuentur. Hunc ego sectari constituo, et arctissima mihi familiaritate
  </p>
  <p>
   conjungere. Ita enim facile, quod deliquerim, in ejus probitate occultabo.’ Placet patri
  </p>
  <p>
   ratio. Itaque se illi philosopho applicat, ejus lateri haeret, concionanti assidet, pallium
  </p>
  <p>
   servat, linteum, quo sudorem abstergat, defert. Sed dum vult occultare se, prodit; dum
  </p>
  <p>
   nititur infamiae vulnera sanare, exulcerat. Magis enim homines in hac tam putida
  </p>
  <p>
   simulatione stomachantur ac offenduntur.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Haec Aridus verbis acerrime persequens, ocularibus ex theca detractis nasoque
  </p>
  <p>
   adhibitis, in summam plateam aciem intendit. Quo etiam Gallonius intuens: “Ecce,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, Salvium Typhernatem cum Lepido Gallutio Sinistro, Minutii filio. Hunc Lepidum
  </p>
  <p>
   Aridus statim laudabit atque extemporalibus versibus ad studium virtutis impellet.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Neque Gallonius aberravit; nam Aridus advorsum Lepido veniens, sic orsus est:
  </p>
  <p>
   Pieridum lux alma, vale, generosa Sinistrae351
  </p>

   Progenies stirpis, qua non praestantior ulla,

   Te salvere jubet longo gravis Aridus aevo,

   Sed gravior vasto veteris sub pondere culpae,

   Quae sursum nitentem animum compellit ad ima.

  <p>
   Ut tenues misero subsint in praelia vires,

   At tibi cana senum teneris mens haeret in annis,

  </p>
  <p>
   Non cessasset usque ad noctem versus effundere, nisi Gallutius, qui fortasse aliquo
  </p>
  <p>
   properabat, salvere jussum reliquisset. Unde conversus ad Gallonium: “Doleo, inquit,
  </p>
  <p>
   me tibi attulisse nuncium non ita jucundum.” “Imo, gratias habeo, ait Gallonius, quod
  </p>
  <p>
   ejus me participem feceris. Restat mihi rogandus dynasta meus ut mittat Praetori qui
  </p>
  <p>
   dicat ut, honoris sui gratia, in causa Lyconis nulla mihi fiat injuria. Non enim dubito quin
  </p>
  <p>
   pro opera, quam illi fideliter navo, patrocinium meum sit arrepturus.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed discedentes remoratur Iberus ille, qui in Academia rationem tuendae per
  </p>
  <p>
   aestatem valetudinis quatuor versiculis comprehenderat, quique revertebatur ex
  </p>
  <p>
   buleuterio, ubi a Poliarchis, praeter prandium, merendam etiam exegerat. Ego non
  </p>
  <p>
   invitus restiti. Eram enim cupidus hominis suavissimi degustandi. At eum videmus
  </p>
  <p>
   pedissequos atratos post se duos habere. Rogat Aridus, quemnam lugeat mortuum?
  </p>
  <p>
   Num fratrem? Num sororem? Num amitam? Num materteram? At ille: “Me, inquit, lugeo
  </p>
  <p>
   extinctum.” “Quid ais? Sanusne es? inquit Aridus. Si ad istam rationem sunt omnes
  </p>
  <p>
   mortui, mortem nihil moror.” Respondet: “Ego dicam tibi. Neminem habeo, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   cognatum neque affinem, qui mihi mortuo funus faciat, neque mea causa sibi familiaeve
  </p>
  <p>
   suae filum atrum imponat. Ergo illud officium, quo cariturus sum mortuus, ipse mihi ex
  </p>
  <p>
   parte vivens impertio. Imo si scias ubi mihi sepulcrum faciendum locaverim, laudes.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Fortasse, inquit Aridus, in aede Apollinis, Minervae, vel Martis?” “Minime, ait ille; sed
  </p>
  <p>
   ad murum urbis, in ea parte, ubi paululum ille inclinat atque propendet; qui locus ‘Ad
  </p>
  <p>
   murum obliquum’ appellatur. Nam arbitror me invenisse rationem a nemine adhuc
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   ludentes colliment, perpetuoque audientur haec verba: ‘Dirigamus pilam ad saxum
  </p>
  <p>
   Iberi.’ Neque multi dies intercedent cum locus ille, commutato nomine, ‘Saxum Iberi’
  </p>
  <p>
   vocabitur. Atque paucos hic habeo versiculos, quos saxo illi incidendos locem.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Obsecro, inquit Aridus, nisi molestum est, perlege. Nunquam enim propagandi nominis
  </p>
  <p>
   causa elegantius quidquam me audisse confiteor.” Tum Iberus: “Nihil possum tibi
  </p>
  <p>
   roganti negare!”
  </p>
  <p>
   Hic situs ille jacet, qui nomine dictus Iberus
  </p>

  <p>
   Risimus omnes elegans et amoenum hominis ingenium. Sed ille: “Missa isthaec, inquit,

  <p>
   faciamus. Cras volo, Aride, praediolum tuum invisere. Praepara mihi jentaculum, vel
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   amico cuidam suo hanc epistolam:

  <p>
   Cras mecum ruri conviva recumbet Iberus,
  </p>
  <p>
   Integer ac validus, cui bona vina placent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Haec dare si nequeo, tumidus mala multa Lavernae

  <p>
   Quod ni quadrantal vini mihi miseris, olim

   Quo repuli febrim, pestiferamque sitim,
  </p>
  <p>
   Hujus jam rabies malesana refringet Iberi
  </p>
  <p>
   Et ruri vites, et mihi fuste caput.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hac epistola perlecta, actisque Arido gratiis, discedimus, et cum Gallonio ad ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   dynastae aedes recta via contendimus. Gallonius sine mora ad dynastam introducitur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed paulo post tristis egreditur. Quaero quid tristis sit? “Nihil,” respondet. Sed conjectis
  </p>
  <p>
   in caelum oculis: “O quinquennium, inquit, apud istum male contritum! Dii, facite ut ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   opis nunquam indigeam.” Rogo iterum quid sibi evenerit. Incipit: “Postquam abeo intro,
  </p>
  <p>
   solum eum deambulantem invenio. Qui ad conspectum meum substitit, expectans quid
  </p>
  <p>
   vellem. Narro quemadmodum Lyco os mihi subleverit. Oro ut me per nuncium Praetori
  </p>
  <p>
   commendet. Eripit mihi ille orationem ac prominenti rictu contractoque supercilio:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Sanusne, inquit, es, qui haec postules? Nescis mihi religionem inesse? Vel jus tecum
  </p>
  <p>
   facit, vel non. Si tecum est, nihil tibi mea opus est commendatione; facile a praetore
  </p>
  <p>
   aequissimo quod justum est impetrabis. Si tibi jus adversatur, mene idoneum censes,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui vim legibus afferam; quique judicum religionem mea commendatione pervertam?’
  </p>
  <p>
   Ego bilem non continui, sed: ‘Quam pridem, inquam, haec te incessit religio? Non eras
  </p>
  <p>
   adeo religiosus cum Toxillum, hominem impurum atque sacrilegum, ita commendabas,
  </p>
  <p>
   ut non posses vehementius.’ Ille iratus: ‘Vide, ait, arrogantiam hominis et impudentiam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Non praegustatorem mihi conduxi, sed dominum et magistrum. Commendavi illum, quia
  </p>
  <p>
   192
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi libuit, nunc non libet. Quid hoc? Audistin? An nondum etiamne hoc quidem.’361 His
  </p>
  <p>
   auditis, non expectandum censui, dum fustem sumeret ac me plagis contunderet.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Quid, inquam ego, idne tristis es? Tantane tibi amicorum penuria est, ut nunquam sit
  </p>
  <p>
   auxilium, nisi in hoc uno?” “Nulla apud nos vilior est, inquit, annona quam hominum
  </p>
  <p>
   officiosorum.362 Nam sunt dynastae omnes in hanc rem ad ambitionem usque propensi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Verum id causae meae adversarium est maxime. Putabit enim praetor me fracta apud
  </p>
  <p>
   dynastam meum navi, adventiciae nescio cujus commendationis tabulam arripuisse.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quamobrem cum hac suspicione non modo ille me ad voti mei successum, tanquam ad
  </p>
  <p>
   litus, non impellet, verum etiam exortae tempestati exagitandum exorbendumque
  </p>
  <p>
   concedet.” Tum ego: “Quid facias? Mussitandae sunt principum virorum injuriae363; et
  </p>
  <p>
   dolor tuus ex hac repulsa conceptus, donariis leniendus quibus ab eo quotidie
  </p>
  <p>
   compleris.” “Derides, inquit Gallonius, tu me? Genium meum iratum habeam,364 si toto
  </p>
  <p>
   hoc quinquennio, quo hujus diaria rodo,365 ex illius donariis nummo uno aureo sum

  </p>
  <p>
   omnes ejus facultates ac divitias futuras mecum cum ipso communes. Ita promissa

  <p>
   largiter extendebat. Ac memini in primis esse pollicitum: ‘O Galloni, modo aliquid inveni,

  <p>
   Hic ego, correptus furore poëtico, extemporale hoc carmen effudi:
  </p>
  <p>
   Quid dominum tumidae contundis verbere linguae,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quod tibi promissam ferre negarit opem?
  </p>
  <p>
   Non jure irrisum sic te indignaris in uno;
  </p>
  <p>
   Cum tot deludant decipiantque dolis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spem mentitur ager, caelum tibi saepe serenum
  </p>
  <p>
   Imposuit, fregit portus et ipse fidem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aut simul haec odiis durus complectere. Vel si
  </p>
  <p>
   Nolis, cur uni parcere, inepte, negas?
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed haec hactenus. “Nolo, ait Gallonius, inhumanitas cujusquam mihi hilaritatem
  </p>
  <p>
   meam et coenae367 curam eripiat. Obsonatum eamus; et quo intelligatis, nullam
  </p>
  <p>
   cujusquam injuriam posse meum mihi morem excutere, volo vos hoc vespere unctius

  </p>
  <p>
   pullos, pisces ac scitamenta plura coëmimus, redimus, coenamus369 ac coenati cubitum
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   identidem ab eo voces eliciebat: “Quam multa in servitute iniqua expetunt?370 Opulento

   368 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. V n. 13) notes that “polimenta” is a lectio dubia in Plaut. Men. I.iii.211 and

   cites an alternate reading of lines 209-11: “Atque aliquid scitamentorum de foro opsonarier . . . aut

  </p>
  <p>
   philosophandi cupidior: “Quid tu, inquit, cum istis tuis sapientibus dictis? Aut tace, aut
  </p>
  <p>
   dormi. Nihil est opus lamentationibus ubi ad lapides loqueris. Iniqua est concertatio,

  <p>
   Postquam aurora illuxit, lecto surreximus, et cum abeundi tempus instaret,
  </p>
  <p>
   profectionem adornare instituimus. Itaque lineas vestes ac laneas emimus. Ad haec, ne
  </p>
  <p>
   eodem ac remiges vino uti, ac nautico pane383 semper vesci nobis esset necesse, vina
  </p>
  <p>
   optima, siligineos panes, pernam, laridum, sumen,384 farcimina, atque alia id genus
  </p>
  <p>
   edulia congessimus. Relinquebatur zona pene inanis a pecunia. Re adeo iter

  <p>
   smaragdos, chrysolithos,385 adamantes, margaritas, et alias ejusmodi gemmas, quas
  </p>
  <p>

   383 panis nauticus: a hard dry bread that is eaten after being soaked in water to render it soft. Because it
  </p>
  <p>
   is dry it is easy to pack and store, and it maintains well on long voyages. In English it can be called ship’s

   cupiditasque perduxit. Etenim tota haec insula, ut vino, olio, tritico, auro, et argento

   abundet, ab his tamen deliciis sane nuda est et vacua. Et raro huc mercatores

   Sed properato opus est, ut eum domi opprimamus.” Nos dicto audientes, addimus

  <p>
   gradum. Sed properantes Aridi academici servus offendit, ac: “Salvere te, inquit, jubeo,
  </p>
  <p>
   Galloni. Quo te agis? Quid sibi vult ista tua tam praepropera festinatio?” “Ad aedes,

  <p>
   inquit, Zanchae, vicini tui (id enim proxenetae386 illi erat nomen) me confero; ita nunc
  </p>
  <p>
   subito objectum est mihi negocium,387 ut eo convento opus sit.” “At volo te, ait, itineris

   hujus laborem lucri facere388; non est domi. At si tantopere conventum eum expetis,
  </p>
  <p>
   quid meream, si ostendero ubi parvulo labore nullo errore reperias?” “Cedo, inquit

   Gallonius, ubi sit; neque occupatis moram injicias.” “Reliqui eum nuper, ait, in officina

  </p>
  <p>
   Pamphilus uxorem duxit?” “Certe, ait ille. Et, quod magis mireris, fabri lignarii filiam in

   it as “not to waste a trip.”

   tabellis quas gestas?” “Defero eas, ait, ad Thersippum dynastam, quem herus meus

  <p>
   hominis hic Thersippus esset. Num litteratus, cui docti homines scriberent? Num ruris
  </p>
  <p>
   amator, qui villarum amoenitates persequeretur? “Atqui, inquit Gallonius, hic est vir, suo

  </p>
  <p>
   judicio valde sapiens, sed aliorum existimatione non stultus. Praestat ingenio, notitia
  </p>
  <p>
   antiquitatis, juris civilis scientia. Verum haec ille majora multo existimat esse quam
  </p>
  <p>
   quanta in ipso existant. Nam facie, vultu, admirando irridendoque persuadere conatur,
  </p>
  <p>
   in ejus labris eloquentiae deam haerere, atque in ipsius pectore iurisprudentiam,
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam in arce, regnare. Attamen litteratis juris, qui honoris eum causa sectantur,
  </p>
  <p>
   praebet se benevolum et amantem; sed ejus haec in illos voluntas tantum intra verba
  </p>
  <p>
   concluditur, ac raro, vel nunquam, ad facta digreditur; et vix unus aut alter invenitur, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   ejus auctoritate vel gratia ad divitias honoresque pervenerit. Sed eccum, ipsus393 adest,
  </p>
  <p>
   atque ille est quem gestatoria inclusum sella deferri videtis.” Erat aestas summa,
  </p>
  <p>
   calores maximi; et tamen sella ferebatur ita ab omni parte clausa, ut nihil esset ad
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes cujusvis aurae vel levis incursus magis munitum ac tectum; solum ad
  </p>
  <p>
   accipiendam lucem binae hinc et illinc et in fronte fenestellae, crystallis tamen obductae,
  </p>
  <p>
   patebant; ipse vero, multis sibi caput velis devinxerat, ac pallio corpus diligenter
  </p>
  <p>
   involverat. Nos exquisitam hominis diligentiam in frigore propulsando mirati, ac prope
  </p>
  <p>
   medium Janum emensi, eo loci devenimus ubi proxeneta ille dictus est esse; atque eum
  </p>
  <p>
   invenimus, medium inter duos sedentem, cachinnos effusissimos edere. Prior occupat
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius, ac salvere eum jubet; gemmas explicat atque emptorem ut inveniat rogat. Ille
  </p>
  <p>
   in manus sumit, inspicit, laudat, et: “Commodiorem, ait, hominem et adventum non vidi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam hodie instruendus est mihi Pamphilo mundus muliebris,394 quem mittat uxori quam
  </p>
  <p>
   duxit.” “Audivi, inquit Gallonius, ac miratus sum adolescentem, adeo locupletem ac
  </p>
  <p>
   393 ipsus: archaic form of ipse.
  </p>
  <p>
   394 mundus muliebris: a set of women’s toiletries, or her toilet or dressing room, e.g., Dig. 34.2.25:
  </p>
  <p>
   “mundus muliebris est, quo mulier mundior fit: continentur eo specula, matulae, unguenta, vasa
  </p>
  <p>
   unguentaria.”
  </p>
  <p>
   200
  </p>
  <p>
   nobilem, ad eam humilitatem descendisse, ut fabri lignarii filiam pro uxore velit habere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tantane hodie conditionum penuria laboratur?” “Ita, inquit Zancha, sese res habet. Fieri
  </p>
  <p>
   aliter non potuit; vis eum coëgit.” “At quae vis, ait Gallonius, cogit ut quam nolis
  </p>
  <p>
   accipias?” “Res est ridicula, inquit ille, ac modo istis narrare occeperam.” “Repete, nisi
  </p>
  <p>
   molestum est, ait Gallonius. Nam gestio audire.” “Date igitur operam,” inquit. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   conantem dicere juvenis antevertit, qui, ex improviso erumpens, his Natalicium dictis
  </p>
  <p>
   aggreditur: “Quid, obsecro, mulieris mihi in matrimonium dedisti? Qua muliere nulla alia
  </p>
  <p>
   est flagitiosior ac nequior. Modo pene eam cum adolescente nescio quo caput
  </p>
  <p>
   limantem395 oppressi. At si mihi post hunc diem aliquid tale suboleat, faxo foris vidua te
  </p>
  <p>
   patrem suum invisat.”396 Qua re Natalicius, non mediocriter perturbatus, inquit: “Adeone
  </p>
  <p>
   mirum tibi videtur, si intemperanter mulier adolescens facit? Paucas quippe invenias,
  </p>
  <p>
   quas adolescentiae aestus in has delicias ac blandimenta non abstrahat. Non possunt
  </p>
  <p>
   haec ab adolescentia sejungi; quae etiam simul cum ea deflorescunt ac desinunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interea sine ut det aliquid temporis ad ludum aetatis.397 Sed quantum audio,
  </p>
  <p>
   matrissat.398 Nam quae mater ejus, uxor mea, lusit ad hunc modum, potuerunt populo
  </p>
  <p>
   viritim dispertiri.399 Nunc autem, aetate confecta, ita est aliena ab his nugis, ut nulla sit
  </p>
  <p>
   aeque castior ac melior materfamilias.” Adolescens, nihilo hac responsione placatior
  </p>
  <p>
   factus, nescio quid mussans, pedem retulit. Quo abeunte, sic orsus est Zancha:
  </p>
  <p>
   395 limare caput alicui: to kiss someone (e.g., Plaut. Poen. I.ii.292 and Merc. III.i.537).
  </p>
  <p>
   396 Plaut. Men. I.ii.112-3: “praeterhac si mihi tale post hunc diem / faxis, faxo foris vidua visas patrem.”
  </p>
  <p>
   397 Cf. Cic. Cael. XII.28: “Datur enim concessu omnium huic aliqui ludus aetati, et ipsa natura profundit
  </p>
  <p>
   adulescentiae cupiditates.”
  </p>
  <p>
   398 The suffux -isso (or -izo) signifies to imitate, or adopt the style or tone of, whatever it modifies (e.g.,
  </p>
  <p>
   “Graecisso,” to imitate the Greeks). Eud. 1998, Lib. VI n. 2: “Cf. verbum comicum ‘patrissare.’”

  <p>
   cum omnibus sua consilia credere, fidem habere, depositum nullo teste reddere solitus

   Saturnalibus, cum Baldoccius solito maturius domo migrasset, ut amici cujusdam sui
  </p>
  <p>
   vina degustaret, nudatum propugnatoribus vallum405 hostis ingreditur; commissoque
  </p>
  <p>
   praelio praeda potitur. Quid multa? Dum Baldoccius amplis et profundis cantharis
  </p>
  <p>
   potitans hilarem sumit diem, amatores ad ebrietatem usque sese voluptatibus explent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neque eo tantum die suo obsecuti sunt animo; sed deinceps diebus omnibus, qua hora

  </p>
  <p>
   neque aliqua ludendi satietas esset, ex improviso parentes Tensae domum adveniunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quamobrem magnus adolescentem metus invadit. Cui puella, nihil exterrita: ‘Ne pave,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit; mox tibi fugae rationem expeditam dabo. Unum mihi dolet, quod voluntate mea
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   quod ad dexteram cubiculum habet adjunctum, ad sinistram in culinam exit, ubi tunc

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   fugiens triticum quasillis406 excipiunt, adolescens vasa collegit et castra commovit. At
  </p>
  <p>
   Tensa minus eam voluptatem faciens, quae cum periculo metuque conjungeretur,
  </p>
  <p>
   cogitare secum ipsamet coepit, quanam ratione eam puram sine timoris cujusquam
  </p>
  <p>
   faece perciperet. Et, in regionem suarum astutiarum ingressa,407 contra parentum
  </p>
  <p>
   simplicitatem dolos instruxit atque, ut est in excogitando inveniendoque acuta, paucis
  </p>
  <p>
   diebus post cum ad se Pamphilus venisset, suamque ex eo voluptatem explesset,
  </p>
  <p>
   reversis sub vesperam parentibus, moestam se atque exanimatam ostendit. Interrogata
  </p>
  <p>
   quid esset, non audebat dicere, sed pro verbis lacrimarum vim dabat. Verum aliquando,
  </p>
  <p>
   coacta, dixit esse quosdam Lemures, qui humana forma atque figura domos virginum
  </p>
  <p>
   celebrarent atque eas misere deperirent. Unum ergo istorum Lemurum a se visum,

   te macerat, amove. Mihi enim spes est, posthac nunquam tuis istam oculis larvam
  </p>
  <p>
   occursuram.’ ‘Ah nescis, mater, inquit Tensa, quam alte ea mihi haereat in animo.’ His

   dictis, ad ea quibus maxime indigebat, hoc est, ad cibum quietemque se contulit.

  <p>
   Postridie revertitur Pamphilus novus daemon, sed ex eo genere quos incubos vocant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Qui, ut se ad parentes mulieris conciliaret, inaures et torquem novo opere factum
  </p>
  <p>
   Tensae reliquit, quae ipsa laetanti animo parentibus suis ostendit. Illi in manus sumere,
  </p>
  <p>
   contemplari, laudare, et tanquam ex Vulcani officina, profecta mirari. Jamque se adigi
  </p>
  <p>
   406 quasillum and quasillus (diminutive of qualum): a small basket used for various purposes but
  </p>
  <p>
   especially for holding wool in a spinning room.
  </p>
  <p>
   407 Plaut. Mil. II.ii.233: “in regionem astutiarum mearum te induco.”
  </p>
  <p>
   204
  </p>
  <p>
   sentiebant, ut tam elegantem ac tam liberalem daemonem absentem diligerent. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   dona perpetuando assecutus est Pamphilus, ut nihil eisdem se carius existeret. Antina,
  </p>
  <p>
   ut mos est mulierum, ardebat cupiditate incredibili ejus Lemuris conspiciendi. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   paululum timore perterrebatur. Verum, tum frequentibus Pamphili donis, tum filiae
  </p>
  <p>
   oratione confirmata, quae de ejus forma ac venustate mira narrabat, suis eum oculis
  </p>
  <p>
   videre constituit. Est, ut probe nosti, Pamphilus annos natus undeviginti, capillo
  </p>
  <p>
   subcrispo, nigris oculis, candidisque genis leviter rubore suffusis; ne tenue quidem
  </p>
  <p>
   barbae vestigium inhaeret; praeterea vestitu ornatuque corporis, prout ejus opes ferunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   quae sunt satis amplae, semper excultus. Quamobrem simul ut Antinae pervenit ad
  </p>
  <p>
   oculos: ‘Hui, quam est elegans! inquit. Ubi sunt, qui totum istud genus Lemurum forma
  </p>
  <p>
   esse horribili praedicant? Jam pol, si ad istam faciem sunt omnes, nihil moror, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   minus quantum est ubique Lemurum meam in domum immigret, ne semper
  </p>
  <p>
   cadaverosam Baldoccii mei faciem necesse habeam aspicere.’ Sed jam Baldoccius rem
  </p>
  <p>
   apud vicinos omnem divulgaverat, de amoribus Lemurum, de ipsorum donis; mirosque
  </p>
  <p>
   de sua stultitia ludos sermonesque praebebat. Interrogatus an daemon hic cornibus
  </p>
  <p>
   praeditus esset: ‘Quid malum, inquit, vobis venit in mentem cogitare istuc de eo, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   non facile quidquam dixerim me vidisse in vita venustius?’ ‘At hoc ridiculum est, inquit
  </p>
  <p>
   alter, quod, cum ipse cornibus careat, te cornutissimum faciat.’ ‘At te magnus perdat
  </p>
  <p>
   Juppiter, inquit Baldoccius, qui umbras aëre ventoque conflatas humano more
  </p>
  <p>
   concumbere existimas.’ ‘Quid si,’ excepit alter, ‘ventus hic masculus filiae tuae ventrem
  </p>
  <p>
   impleverit? Quid dicturus es?’ Alii, quos Baldoccii stultitiae miserebat, pro amicitia et
  </p>
  <p>
   vicinitate eum, ut magnam infamiam fugeret, admonebant et sycophantam illum domo
  </p>
  <p>
   fuste quantum potest ejiceret. Hos ille ex invidentia loqui dicebat. E re enim sua esse, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   205
  </p>
  <p>
   non unus modo, sed mille etiam Lemures domum suam incolerent. Tum: ‘Tu igitur,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit unus, ob leve nescio quod lucrum tantum in existimatione tua damnum accipias?
  </p>
  <p>
   At vide ne, ubi filiam dare nuptum voles, haec mala illi umbra plurimum obsit. Nescis
  </p>
  <p>
   quantum fama ad conciliandas nuptias valeat?’ Cui Baldoccius: ‘Tace, inquit, inepte;
  </p>
  <p>
   non tu nunc mores hominum vides?’
  </p>
  <p>
   Quojusmodi hic cum fama facile nubitur?
  </p>
  <p>
   Dum dos sit, nullum vitium vitio vortitur.408
  </p>
  <p>
   Quid opus est verbis? Baldoccio persuasum erat posse antea asinos volaticos esse,
  </p>
  <p>
   quam ullum sibi filiaeque suae dedecus ab umbris, quae aere ventoque constarent,
  </p>
  <p>
   inferri. Sed opinionem suam fefellit eventus. Nam aër ille in humorem crassum
  </p>
  <p>
   carnosumque conflatus, Tensae praeter modum ventrem inflavit. Ac primo persuasit
  </p>
  <p>
   parentibus, non in visceribus, sed in cute morbum haerere, atque aqua inter cutem
  </p>
  <p>
   laborare se dixit.409 Tum, cum partus instaret, matri veram morbi causam aperuit. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   ejus culpam non ad daemonem illum familiarem suum, nec ad virum aliquem, sed ad
  </p>
  <p>
   somnium quoddam referebat. Menses enim abhinc septem se meminisse somniare ab
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescente quodam comprimi, atque ab eo die paulatim ventrem intumescendo ad
  </p>
  <p>
   eam altitudinem excrevisse. Antina, tametsi stulta est, ac mater, non continuo huic
  </p>
  <p>
   fabulae assensionem adhibuit; sed, ut quemque vel medicum vel amicum occurrerat,
  </p>
  <p>
   408 Plaut. Pers. III.i.385-7: “Tace, stulta. non tu nunc hominum mores vides? quoivis modi hic cum [mala]
  </p>
  <p>
   fama facile nubitur / dum dos sit, nullum vitium vitio vortitur” (the quote from Plautus includes the line of
  </p>
  <p>
   prose just before the couplet). IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. VI n. 3) adds the word “mala” in square brackets
  </p>
  <p>
   before “fama” in the first line of the couplet with the intention of restoring the verse to what appears in
  </p>
  <p>
   Plautus. While “mala” does appear as the accepted reading in recent editions of Plautus, older editions do
  </p>
  <p>
   not universally include the word. For example, M. Accii Plauti Latinae comoediae facile principis fabulae
  </p>
  <p>
   superstites XX (Lugduni Batavorum: Ex officina Plantiniana, apud Franciscum Raphelengium, 1589) does
  </p>
  <p>
   not have it, while M. Actii Plauti Comoediae viginti (Lugduni: Apud Seb. Gryphium, 1554) does. I have left
  </p>
  <p>
   the text without “mala” because it is an accepted contemporary reading and it reflects Rossi’s text.
  </p>

   409 aqua inter cutem: an alternative medical term for hydrops, or dropsy, which is now called edema.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   statim num virgo absque ullo concubitu praegnans fieri posset interrogabat. Cui alius
  </p>
  <p>
   aliud respondebat. Erat tamen nonnemo, qui diceret num, quod vigilans filia passa
  </p>
  <p>
   esset, somnio tribueretur? Cui illa: ‘Cave, inquit, istuc de filia mea tibi veniat in mentem,
  </p>
  <p>
   qua ne columba quidem ulla est purior nec sanctior.’ Tum ille: ‘Quasi columbae, ait,
  </p>
  <p>
   parere non soleant!’ Ne multa; tantisper Antina suspenso incertoque fuit animo, donec
  </p>
  <p>
   columbum columbam ineuntem intuetur. Nam cum ad rimulas ostii, quid intus geritur
  </p>
  <p>
   aucupat, videt id quod jam pridem, nisi stulta esset, intelligere potuisset; ac tum demum,
  </p>
  <p>
   quo ex Orco Erinnys illa prodiisset, animadvertit. Itaque, dolore amens, clamores tollere,
  </p>
  <p>
   popularium fidem implorare, impurissimum sycophantam, familiae suae pestem,
  </p>
  <p>
   corruptorem filiae manu tenere se dicere. Hic vicini omnes accurrere, adolescentem
  </p>
  <p>
   objurgare, qui tam impudenter honestos homines luderet, et virgini ingenuae vitium
  </p>
  <p>
   afferret. Ad haec minas addere; carcerem et praetorem objicere, qui ejus supplicio
  </p>
  <p>
   inustam optimis viris infamiae notam elueret. Scitis quam parvo momento adolescentis
  </p>
  <p>
   animus huc illuc impellitur. Sed Pamphilum non tam illorum minae, quam Tensae amor
  </p>
  <p>
   consuetudoque, movebat; cui amori, nisi prospectum interea esset, dissidium, distractio,
  </p>
  <p>
   vastitas imminebat. Qua re permotus adolescens, locuples ac domi suae nobilis, eo
  </p>
  <p>
   descendit ut fabri lignarii filiam sibi in matrimonium dari deposceret. Quam statim
  </p>
  <p>
   Baldoccius eidem spopondit. Sed videre videor jam diem illum quo adolescentem hujus
  </p>
  <p>
   matrimonii poeniteat.” “At non erit illi difficile, inquit Gallonius, ab eo discedere cum
  </p>
  <p>
   volet, atque alteram genere, copiis et existimatione sibi parem adjungere.” Quod ego
  </p>
  <p>
   admirans: “Audieram, inquam, matrimonia hic esse perpetua, ac tantum morte dissolvi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Qua igitur via hoc nefas aggredietur?” “Ea, inquit, quae multorum jam trita itineribus
  </p>
  <p>
   patet, quamque Antiphila nuper inivit. Nempe, si testibus planum faciat, eas nuptias non
  </p>
  <p>
   207
  </p>
  <p>
   rite, nec legibus, sed vi metuque conjunctas. Nam praetor vim factam restituit.”410 “Quid
  </p>
  <p>
   audio? Natalitius ait; Antiphila vidua est, viro superstite? Ea, inquam, Antiphila, quae
  </p>
  <p>
   Demophonti aromatario nupserat?” “Ea ipsa, inquit Gallonius. Etenim, cum saepius in
  </p>
  <p>
   adulterio deprehensa a viro verberaretur, quadriennio post, quam in viri manum
  </p>
  <p>
   convenit, commenta est matrimonium illud metu fuisse coactum. Ideoque dissolvendum
  </p>
  <p>
   dirimendumque curasse. Quod statim perfectum est, scribae cujusdam opera. Cujus
  </p>
  <p>
   sane ordinis ad haec atque alia nefaria perpetranda improbissimis hominibus plurimum
  </p>
  <p>
   prodest audacia.” Sed tanta nos voluptate affecerant docti Tensae doli, et ad
  </p>
  <p>
   decipiendum tam scite instructa in corde concilia, ut exclamarem: “Pluris est, O Zancha,
  </p>
  <p>
   tua isthaec lepida atque jucunda narratio quam gemmae quibus nobis opus est
  </p>
  <p>
   venditis.” “Si ita, inquit Zancha, tibi videtur, cedo gemmas. Atque illud insuper redde,
  </p>
  <p>
   quo minoris sunt gemmae.411 Sed vos arbitror ludere, neque huc logos emptum tanto
  </p>
  <p>
   precio venisse. Sequimini igitur me.” Manuque prehensos duxit in fórum, jussitque
  </p>
  <p>
   numerari nobis a trapezita tria talenta magna argenti. Nos laeti quod mercimonium
  </p>
  <p>
   nostrum tam lepide processisset ac referti pecunia, domum regredimur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed redeuntes, in turbam incidimus. Nam dynasta Orius, qui erat etiam sacerdos
  </p>
  <p>
   Cereris, sacra eidem facturus in ejus fanum solemni ritu prodibat. Praecedebat familia
  </p>
  <p>
   ejusdem tota, et in ea alii honesti viri complures, qui eum honoris gratia sectabantur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Proximi veniebant ministri, quorum alius urceum, alius pateram, alius acerram plenam
  </p>
  <p>
   410 vim restituere: to restore possession of that from which one has been forcibly driven (Riddle 1836).
  </p>
  <p>
   411 I have translated “illud insuper redde quo minoris sunt gemmae” as “declare the gemstones to be of
  </p>
  <p>
   diminished value,” assuming that “quo minoris” is a reference to the concept of “iudicium” or “actio quo
  </p>
  <p>
   minoris,” which, to quote Nettleship (1889: 65), has to do with a “suit to determine doubtful points in a
  </p>
  <p>
   contract” in the sale of slaves or other chattel. Cf. Dig. 21.1.38 where “quo minoris” is translated as
  </p>
  <p>
   “diminution of price” (should an animal be found sick after a sale has been completed) (Mommsen,
  </p>
  <p>
   Krueger, and Watson 1985: 156).

   thuris ferebat. Hos sequebatur flamen amictus laena; et quacunque iter faceret, dabant
  </p>
  <p>
   illi viam nobiles atque plebeii, aperiebant capita,412 et procumbebant in genua. In his qui
  </p>
  <p>
   de via secesserant, agnovimus aliquot, qui triduo ante in illo eruditorum conventu
  </p>
  <p>
   magnam ingenii laudem erant adepti. Ipse vero flamen erectus ac celsus nemini se
  </p>
  <p>
   dabat, omnes aeque despiciebat. Erat inter plebeculam, quae ad visendum accurrerat,
  </p>
  <p>
   tunicatus unus cum castula scortea, praecinctus zona, ad quam ferramenta multa
  </p>
  <p>
   pendebant, videlicet malleus, forceps, scalprum, sacculus plenus clavorum.413 Hunc
  </p>
  <p>
   Flamen, ita ut erat ornatus, ad se vocat, sibi comitem addit. Interrogat quid rerum agat,
  </p>
  <p>
   ut valeat, num equo, quem ipsi curandum locaverat, dolores pedum remisissent, num
  </p>
  <p>
   aliqua salutis spes esset. Quod ego vehementer admirans: “Cur hic, inquam, Galloni, vir
  </p>
  <p>
   summus tantoque sacerdotio praeditus, quo tempore, pontificiis insignibus ornatus, rei
  </p>
  <p>
   omnium gravissimae daturus est operam, tot honestis viris contemptis ac spretis,
  </p>
  <p>
   pannosum hunc eligit, quicum eat in via ac sermones instituat? Quae tam inter se
  </p>
  <p>
   distant, quam Pontifex et faber ferrarius? Quid tam alienum ac discrepans, quam laena
  </p>
  <p>
   pontificis et fabri ferramenta? Equidem nequeo satis mirari rationem istius.” “Inepta
  </p>
  <p>
   mehercle est, inquit Gallonius, et stulta. Sed quid facias? Hic ut ex ornatu potes
  </p>
  <p>
   conjicere, equos soleis induit. Sed eo more hic vivitur, ut principibus viris longe sit carior
  </p>
  <p>
   equus vel simia, vel aliqua alia nihili bestia, quam quidquid est ubique litteratorum
  </p>
  <p>
   hominum et honestorum. Nam, si eorum aliquis aeger in lecto decumbat, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   quisquam invisit, neque significatione aliqua ejus sibi salutem cordi esse declarat. At, si
  </p>
  <p>
   equo pes doleat, ecce subito clamores, querelae. Quicunque equos calceant evocantur,
  </p>
  <p>
   412 aperire caput: take off (doff) one’s hat.
  </p>
  <p>
   413 These are the tools of a farrier (or blacksmith) for shoeing horses.
  </p>
  <p>
   209
  </p>
  <p>
   vota pro ejus salute nuncupantur, invisuntur; operae, sumptui, labori non parcitur. Hoc
  </p>
  <p>
   ideo fit, quia homines probi doctique nullo sunt honore vel numero; bestiae in precio
  </p>
  <p>
   habentur. Possum illud addere, quod in hac Republica omnia ea munera, quae
  </p>
  <p>
   debentur industriae, amicitiae traduntur et gratiae. Nam si, verbi causa, eligendus sit
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquis ab epistolis vel a cognitionibus, non continuo ille conducitur qui sit
  </p>
  <p>
   eloquentissimus ac doctissimus; illum conducunt potius quem amicus commendet, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   utilitas ususque suadeat. Quo fit, ut istorum epistolae ac judicia, id quod minime ipsi
  </p>
  <p>
   laborant, ab iis irrideantur apud quos haec studia vigent.” Tum ego stomachans:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Eamus, inquam, domum, ac jentaculo nos reficiamus. Pudet enim diutius in hac urbe
  </p>
  <p>
   versari, quae pejor est ea quam fugimus.” Venimus igitur domum, mensulam appositam
  </p>
  <p>
   invenimus; decumbimus. Paulo post adest a nauclero nuncius, qui magnopere ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   verbis nos admonet ut, si ituri sumus, eamus; ventum operam dare,414 ac nos solos
  </p>
  <p>
   esse in mora. Quamobrem consurgimus, vestes acceptas a Gallonio deponimus,
  </p>
  <p>
   nostras induimus, et cum eo ad portum uno contendimus, navem conscendimus; et
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonium, semel iterumque complexi, donatum torque annuloque cum gemma,
  </p>
  <p>
   relinquimus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed vix Gallonius abierat, cum adest pictor quidam, quem Ballionem vocabant,
  </p>
  <p>
   atque opere petit maximo,415 ut navi nobiscum una tollatur cum muliere, quam uxorem
  </p>
  <p>
   esse suam ajebat. Navarchus, qui eum nosset, quique ejus artificio delectaretur,
  </p>
  <p>
   quamvis plena navi, non respuit, et simul: “Quid, inquit, audio de uxore? Nonne isthaec
  </p>
  <p>
   414 Plaut. Mil. IV.iv.1184-5: “Huc venito et matris verbis Philocomasium arcessito, / ut, si itura sit Athenas,
  </p>
  <p>
   eat tecum ad portum cito, / atque ut iubeat ferri in navim si quid imponi velit. / nisi eat, te soluturum esse
  </p>
  <p>
   navim: ventum operam dare.” Similar phrasing to Rossi’s is also Barclay, Argenis, Liber II.4: “Aderat
  </p>
  <p>
   interim nauta monebatque ventum operam dare” (Barclay, Riley, and Huber 2004: 324).

  </p>
  <p>
   est Nice, vulgare scortum? Ecquando tibi esse coepit uxor?” “Dicam, ait Ballio. Erat mihi
  </p>
  <p>
   cum isthac commercium una cum aliis pluribus. Sed decem abhinc dies, cum ab ea
  </p>
  <p>
   noctem emissem, nescio quis deus fuit mihi auctor, ut a meretricio quaestu abductam416
  </p>
  <p>
   in matrimonio mihi locarem. Atque, eadem nocte, una cum suis rebus meam domum
  </p>
  <p>
   abduxi, eademque opera aedes illas locandas inscripsi.417 Postridie mane veniunt
  </p>
  <p>
   amatores. Venit primum Callidius frumentarius, qui aedes videt inanes et inscriptas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quaerit, rogat ex iis quibus testibus has compedes indui (nam, re vera, nihil aliud est
  </p>
  <p>
   uxor nisi vinculum merum); ac comperit eam mihi nupsisse. ‘Aedepol, inquit ille, si ita
  </p>
  <p>
   est, tritici decem modii, quos dedi ut hae mihi fores in hunc annum paterent, ad mariti
  </p>
  <p>
   granarium transierunt.’ Venit Creopolis lanius, qui carnariis duobus grandibus se
  </p>
  <p>
   circumductum queritur. Adest Thermopota caupo, qui item per hanc rationem vinum,
  </p>
  <p>
   quod esset mulieri hunc annum, satis sibi ereptum fuisse deplorat. Accurrit Harpax
  </p>
  <p>
   decoctor; ac minis quindecim ex iis pecuniis, quas a creditoribus abraserat, se fuisse
  </p>
  <p>
   tactum indignatur. Properant etiam alii mercatores, quorum singulis suam illam operam,
  </p>
  <p>
   mercede accepta, locaverat; omnesque tanquam furi manifestariae faciunt absenti
  </p>
  <p>
   convicium. Itaque, paucis diebus post, in jus ad Praetorem veniunt; universi impetum in
  </p>
  <p>
   eam faciunt, singuli eidem litem intendunt. Sed, cum tam multis non posset obsisti,
  </p>
  <p>
   neque illa e re sua esse existimaret, quod semel in se ingurgitasset, evomere; statuit
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam oppida hostilia eos habere, hoc est, direptos eversosque relinquere, atque in
  </p>
  <p>
   Geryonis regnum mecum una transmittere.” “Fecistis eleganter, inquit nauclerus; neque

   416 Cic. Phil. 2.44: “Primo vulgare scortum; certa flagiti merces nec ea parva; sed cito Curio intervenit, qui

  <p>
   aliter factum oportuit. Aedepol, possunt illi praeficas418 conducere, quae pecuniae,
  </p>
  <p>
   quam repetunt, naeniam canant.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Erat in eadem navi foenerator, domi suae nobilis, qui ex ipsa importunitate atque
  </p>
  <p>
   molestia natus videbatur, adeo erat importunus ac molestus. Hic, tanquam si in
  </p>
  <p>
   amatoribus Nicae ipse esset expilatus ac deceptus, continuo, ore amarissimo, coepit
  </p>
  <p>
   inclementissima tum in Nicem, tum in totam meretricum nationem dicta dicere. Et: “Quid
  </p>
  <p>
   mirum est, ait, si perfide, si maliciose, si nequiter, si avare mulier meretrix facit, cui vita
  </p>
  <p>
   est alterum fallere, ac blandiciis et illecebris bonis patriis evertere? Est meretrix
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam immensa quaedam vorago et gurges vitiorum.419 Est meretrix calamitas, quae
  </p>
  <p>
   praediorum fructus intercipit. Est scopulus, ad quem adolescentium praesertim fortunae,
  </p>

   devorat. Est mare acerrimum420 quod nunquam datis satiatur, neque expletur. Immo
  </p>
  <p>
   mare haud aeque est avidum ut meretrix. Nam in mare quod influit, occulte relabitur, ut

  <p>
   Ballio, qui nihil hominem metueret, una cum uxore conatus est in os seni involare. Sed

   Sed, sublatis discordiis, consecuta est hilaritas jocusque. Nam pictorem illum

  <p>
   notissimus Cynicus, summus rerum humanarum contemptor, ac vitiorum insectator
  </p>
  <p>
   acerrimus. Qui coepit crebras ad cives conciones habere, ac loqui liberius de eorum
  </p>
  <p>
   improbitate atque nequitia. At cum oppidi dominus, ejus se objurgationibus in primis
  </p>
  <p>
   expeti intelligeret, lectica impositum, ditionis suae finibus ejiciendum eum curavit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Verum ita illinc discessit, ut magnam sanctitatis innocentiaeque de se opinionem apud
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes relinqueret. At postridie oppidum illud intrat peregrina virgo, Vestalis habitu. Non
  </p>
  <p>
   ex genere earum, quae communium parietum septis inclusae, seorsum a reliqua turba
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Huic virgini Minervae sigillum ex aere, tanquam crepundia, in collo pendebat. Unde
  </p>
  <p>
   apud omnes magnam de se castitatis opinionem concitabat. Quam etiam majorem
  </p>
  <p>
   faciebat ex eo, quod se sororem esse Lyi simulabat, atque clarissimas orbis terrarum
  </p>
  <p>
   peregrinationes suscepisse narrabat. Etenim se venisse, ajebat, ad Cererem
  </p>

   Ennensem, ad Apollinem Delphicum, ad Dianam Ephesiam, ad Jovem Ammonium,

   certamen esset inter mulieres nobiles, quaenam earum prior hospitio illam acciperet,
  </p>
  <p>
   convivam sibi adhiberet, suum in cubiculum, atque adeo suum in lectum, dormitum
  </p>
  <p>
   adduceret. Putabant enim ex virginei illius corporis contrectatione, sibi etiam posse
  </p>
  <p>
   sanctitatis ejusdem quidpiam haerere. Quid verbis opus est? Summae cujusdam gloriae
  </p>
  <p>
   instar habebatur, saltem una semel nocte cum illa concubuisse, ut etiam, quibus id
  </p>
  <p>
   minus contigisset, de hoc falso gloriarentur. Et quod magis miremini, inter Vestalium
  </p>
  <p>
   septa, summa cum earum Antistitis voluntate intromissa, aliquot ibi noctes exegit. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   tandem, memor aliarum urbium, quarum etiam mulieribus castissimi sui corporis copiam
  </p>
  <p>
   fieri aequum esse existimabat, coepit profectionem ornare. Hinc mulierum earum
  </p>
  <p>
   lamentationes, hinc fletus exorti; quae mulieres multo quam par erat celerius, illud sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   solatium eripi querebantur. Etenim, jucundissima illius consuetudine nequaquam se
  </p>
  <p>
   esse satiatas clamabant. Sed earum querimoniis aures obstruxit, seque in proximum
  </p>
  <p>
   oppidum contulit, Basilico nomine. Ubi vidua quaedam primaria portarum custodibus in
  </p>
  <p>
   mandatis dederat, ut, si quam mulierem peregrini habitus pedem intro ferentem
  </p>
  <p>
   aspexissent, continuo ad se domum adducerent. Haec genere, copiis et existimatione
  </p>
  <p>
   suorum civium facile princeps, aliquot disposita domi suae cubilia habebat, ubi
  </p>
  <p>
   peregrinis mulieribus hospitium praebendum, pedes abluendos, coenam dandam,
  </p>
  <p>
   lectos sternendos curabat. Hoc igitur novum sanctitatis prodigium simul aspectum et ad
  </p>
  <p>
   viduam deductum est. Ubi, cum cognationem, qua Lyo tam arcte implicabatur, et
  </p>
  <p>
   clarissimas illas a se obitas peregrinationes frequenter in ore haberet, perducta est in
  </p>
  <p>
   conspectum ac colloquium piissimae illius foeminae. Quae adeo castimonia
  </p>
  <p>
   sanctissimisque illius sermonibus delectata est, ut noctu, exclusa ancillula, quae in
  </p>
  <p>
   215
  </p>
  <p>
   suppedaneo425 apud ejus pedes lecto cubitabat, peregrinam introduxerit, atque in illo
  </p>
  <p>
   eodem ancillari lectulo collocaverit. At bona peregrina, mediam circiter noctem, cum ex
  </p>
  <p>
   screatu426 ab oculis viduae somnum abesse cognovisset, coepit dentium se invicem
  </p>
  <p>
   verberantium fragore, summum corporis totius horrorem assimulare; et, interrogata quid
  </p>
  <p>
   esset, se subita correptam febri lethale totis artubus frigus concepisse respondit. At
  </p>
  <p>
   vidua, misericordia capta, suum in lectulum venire eam jussit, secumque stragulum et
  </p>
  <p>
   ceteras vestes, quibus tegeretur, afferre. Quae non est passa se iterum rogari, sed
  </p>
  <p>
   confestim, dicto audiens,427 viduae lectum inscendit. Sed illam non ita multo post sopor
  </p>
  <p>
   rursum invasit. Rem miram, extemplo sanctissima illa peregrina, ex pudica virgine in
  </p>
  <p>
   salacem virum conversa, tanquam admissarius quidam equus, conatus est dormientem
  </p>
  <p>
   inire.428 At illa, eo conatu experrecta: “Quid est hoc?” ait. Cui novus hic vir: “Recte,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, pone metum. Ego, ut me tibi indicem, vir sum, qui hoc ornatu urbes circumeo, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   mulieribus, libidine incensis, sed propinquorum vel existimationis metu in officio retentis,
  </p>
  <p>
   sine cujusquam offensione animum expleam.” Quid putatis lectissimam foeminam in
  </p>
  <p>
   eas angustias comprehensam egisse? Quid consilii coepisse? Num fortasse animum
  </p>
  <p>
   despondisse, vel, quod cuivis ineptae venisset in mentem, clamores extulisse, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   popularium fidem implorasse, unde concursus vicinorum fierent? Nihil horum, sed hilari
  </p>

   postquam non lavi. Neque enim olim, nisi lauta, solita eram viro operam dare. Atque
  </p>
  <p>
   eadem opera ancillam quantum potest hinc abigam, ne quid persentiscat, vel indicium
  </p>
  <p>
   faciat. Tum revertar ad te, ut occasionem tam lepidam mihi in sinum delatam arripiam.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Ac, lecto desiliens, ancillam convenit, admonet, ut unum ex familiaribus excitet, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   subucula ac soleis tantum indutus, ne ceteras vestes sumendo tempus terat, curriculo
  </p>
  <p>
   ad praetorem se conferat, eumque suis verbis oret, ut lictorum ad se cohortem mittat:
  </p>
  <p>
   rem esse flagitiosam, turpem, ac dignam cui quam primum obviam eatur. Ille advolat,
  </p>
  <p>
   rem narrat; praetor non procrastinat, ire lictores jubet. Qui veniunt ac sycophantam illum
  </p>
  <p>
   comprehendunt, vinciunt, in carcerem abstrahunt. Ne multis morer; quaestione habita,
  </p>
  <p>
   post triduum, pannosi habitu, ad supplicium datur, hoc est, homini suspendio vita
  </p>
  <p>
   eripitur. Cujus facti rumor cum ad nos permanasset, ego, quo certior fierem, clam
  </p>
  <p>
   Basilicum usque me contuli. Unde reversus Aspim, ut quemque eorum aspexeram,
  </p>
  <p>
   quorum uxores gloriabantur se dignas fuisse habitas quae vim illam sanctitatis atque
  </p>
  <p>
   pudoris lecto exciperent, oscularentur, contrectarent, continuo ajebam: ‘O te felicem, in
  </p>
  <p>
   cujus domum boni tantum contigit immigrare!’ Ille negare factum. Ego instare factum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed ideo id eum inficiari, ne mihi invidiam faceret. Atque in eadem dissimulatione
  </p>
  <p>
   perseverans, nullius rei me tam poenitere affirmabam, quam quod ejus imaginis formam
  </p>
  <p>
   non in pluribus tabulis descripsissem, easque venales habuissem. Nam pro numero
  </p>
  <p>
   emptorum, ajebam, ac pro vestra in bellissimam illam virginem pietate, totum hunc
  </p>
  <p>
   annum opus mihi non defuisset. Quamobrem brevi ad magnas pecunias pervenissem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ne multa; omnino nemo inveniebatur qui sycophantam illum pedem intro in suam
  </p>
  <p>
   domum tulisse confiteretur.” Non magis attente, quam hilariter, lepidum sycophantae
  </p>
  <p>
   illius commentum acceptum est, quod invenerat, ut mulierum, quae ubique sunt
  </p>
  <p>
   217
  </p>
  <p>
   gentium, potiretur. Fuitque non nemo, qui felicitatem illam homini invidisset, si eidem
  </p>
  <p>
   diuturniorem eam esse licuisset.

  </p>
  <p>
   Iam valido, quemque maxime optaveramus, vento in altum delati, placido
  </p>
  <p>
   tranquilloque mari adeo delectabamur ut, quemadmodum de Achivorum exercitu
  </p>
  <p>
   Pacuvius inquit, laeti piscium lasciviam intueremur429; cum subito, adversa coorta
  </p>
  <p>
   tempestate, eundem in locum rejecti sumus unde discesseramus. Sed Neptunum
  </p>
  <p>
   arbitror fluctus commovisse maritimos, quod certi cujusdam senis, Ligurino nomine, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   nobiscum una vehebatur, fastidium insolentiamque perferre non posset. Huic, supra
  </p>
  <p>
   quam dici potest, moroso atque difficili omnia exhibebant negocium; volatus avium,
  </p>
  <p>
   aurae sibilus, remigum laborantium in reddenda anima sonitus430; quibus etiam
  </p>
  <p>
   minitatus est crucem, si ita respirassent ut aliquis ejus ad aures sonus veniret. Toto illo
  </p>
  <p>
   navigio una cum servo prosecutus est culicem, qui dormienti sibi in aurem
  </p>
  <p>
   insusurraverat. Multa alia praetereo, ne sim longior, quibus odium illud propemodum
  </p>
  <p>
   nos enecavit. Nobis igitur, ita ut dixi, in litus expulsis, aegre impetratum est a navarcho
  </p>
  <p>
   ut liceret Gallonium invisere. Nam se velle, ajebat, simul ac contrarius ille ventus
  </p>
  <p>
   consedisset, navim solvere, neque diem posterum expectare. Propterea properaremus
  </p>
  <p>
   redire. Quamobrem sine ulla mora ad aedes Gallonii venimus per angiportum, quod ad
  </p>
  <p>
   eas recte ferebat. Qui, ut nos aspexit, majorem aliquam esse causam reversionis
  </p>
  <p>
   nostrae existimavit; ac, dimisso Plusio Accipitre, de quo supra commemoravimus, ejus

  </p>
  <p>
   reversionis causam efflagitat. Nos exortam tempestatem, et simul odiosam Ligurini
  </p>
  <p>
   importunitatem exponimus; ac: “Si, inquam, iterum cum eo navigandum sit nobis, nihil
  </p>
  <p>
   est opus carnifice qui animam adimat; satis eam nobis suo ille odio praeripiet antequam
  </p>
  <p>
   portum conspicere valeamus.” “Ne miremini, inquit Gallonius; aeque ille est terra
  </p>
  <p>
   marique omnibus, quibuscum vivit, odiosus. Atque, ut sciatis, vicinia, in qua nuper
  </p>
  <p>
   habitabat, vota fecit pro illius abitu, vel potius interitu. Nam gallos gallinaceos, quotquot
  </p>
  <p>
   circa aedes ipsius erant, capiendos interficiendosque curavit, eo quod interdiu sibi aliud
  </p>
  <p>
   agenti aures obtunderent. Praeterea insignem canem, qui ob ejus festivitatem ab
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus diligebatur, quique latratu fures arcebat, catapulta e catapultario emissa
  </p>
  <p>
   dilaceravit, causatus, quod ipsi volenti quiescere somnos abigeret. Sed re vera quod sit
  </p>
  <p>
   odiosus, saevus, truculentus, immanis. Quid? Nonne multis persecutus est noctibus
  </p>
  <p>
   noctuam, quae occentabat fenestram cubiculi, in quo jacebat, quod oscinem eam esse
  </p>
  <p>
   avem diceret, eique, cui concineret, semper aliquid triste praediceret? Itaque, post
  </p>
  <p>
   multos labores, insidiis exceptam obtruncavit; ejusque caput hastae praefixum, trophaei
  </p>
  <p>
   loco impostum suis aedibus habuit. At nihil est in hoc homine, ut sciatis, praeter corporis
  </p>
  <p>
   proceritatem, generis splendorem summamque superbiam. Erat olim etiam dives; sed
  </p>
  <p>
   nuper in mari bonis elavit,431 itaque nunc trioboli homo est,432 vel potius nihili bestia.433

   Roma sotterranea (see Chapter 3, n. 188). In that work Bosio calls them “grotte arenarie” and gives
  </p>
  <p>
   “catacombe,” “catatombe,” and “cimitero” as three synonyms. I have elected to translate arenariae as
  </p>
  <p>
   catacombs. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 4. Cf. Catull. LXIV.112-5: “inde pedem sospes multa cum
  </p>
  <p>
   laude reflexit / errabunda regens tenui vestigia filo, / ne labyrintheis e flexibus egredientem / tecti
  </p>
  <p>

   pro nostra amicitia, me tibi socium adscribito. Gestio enim mihi aliquas pulcherrimi hujus
  </p>
  <p>
   operis partes adsciscere.” Offuscatus, cognita Plusii vanitate, lepidos sibi ludos ad
  </p>
  <p>
   omnem voluptatem et ocium esse oblatos existimavit, neque ulla ratione dimittendos
  </p>
  <p>
   censuit. Ac primo coepit eum rogare, obsecrare, ne se proderet. Capital enim facere,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui magicas artes colat. Itaque: “Si me, inquit, diligis, si mea tibi salus cordi est, quod
  </p>
  <p>
   scis nescis, et quod vides non vides. Quod autem petis, ut te in societatem recipiam,
  </p>
  <p>
   non meae sunt istae partes, sed ad Stylium amicum nostrum pertinent, qui abest hinc
  </p>
  <p>
   millia passuum circiter centum. Sed honoris tui gratia perficiam, ut minus horis tribus
  </p>
  <p>
   totum hoc iter conficiat, et ad Jani Quadrifrontis templum adveniat. Et gaudeo mehercle
  </p>
  <p>
   hanc a te mihi occasionem fuisse oblatam. Volo enim par illi referre, cujus olim
  </p>
  <p>
   cantionibus ferme horis quinque in hanc urbem ex patria sum extractus.” “O istuc si
  </p>
  <p>
   dederis,” Plusius exclamat, “magnus profecto vir es.” “Obsecro, Offuscatus ait,
  </p>
  <p>
   compesce vocem, ne clama; abi domum; et cura te ut, cum est opus, sis mihi praesto
  </p>
  <p>
   ad Janum. Ego cum clavo laminali illic adero.” Hic est clavus quidam aeneus
  </p>
  <p>
   perantiquus, in Aridi museo nuper ab eo conspectus, qui, quoniam characteres
  </p>
  <p>
   quosdam et notas habet impressas,436 visus est in primis ad eludendum Plusium
  </p>
  <p>
   idoneus magicae artis cupidum. Interea Offuscatus ad Stylii aedes accurrit, qui pridie
  </p>
  <p>
   ejus diei e patria redierat; Plusii stultitiam enarrat; quemadmodum ludos eum fieri velit,
  </p>
  <p>
   exponit. Convenit inter eos, ut Stylius hora ejus diei undecima ocreatus, tanquam si tum
  </p>
  <p>
   primum urbem ingrederetur, ante aedem Jani Quadrifrontis appareat, atque Offuscatum
  </p>
  <p>
   increpet, quod se minus horis tribus in urbem extraxisset. Plusius maturius quam erat
  </p>
  <p>
   436 For IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 6) this brings to mind Apul. Met. III.17: “[Pamphile] apparatu solito
  </p>
  <p>
   instruit feralem officinam, omne genus aromatis et ignorabiliter laminis litteratis.”
  </p>
  <p>
   221
  </p>
  <p>
   imperatum domum ad Offuscatum venit; urget; instat ut eant. Nihil sibi videri longius
  </p>
  <p>
   quam dum ex veteri aliquo sepulcro aulam auri plenam effodiat. Itaque eunt, veniunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Offuscatus in aede Jani, in dextero ad laevam angulo, clavum laminalem solemnibus
  </p>
  <p>
   quibusdam verbis a se nuper inventis humi defigit. Tum schedulam laneo funiculo
  </p>
  <p>
   alligatam ad Plusii collum appendit, in qua inscriptae erant litterae: duo PP, duo CC, et
  </p>
  <p>
   unum R. Quaerentibus nobis, quibus fabula narrabatur, id quid esset, dixit Offuscatus:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Plusius Perdidit Cerebrum Cum Re.’437 Hanc illi schedulam imperavit, ut sibi nunquam
  </p>
  <p>
   adimeret, sed perpetuo eam sineret tanquam crepundia in collo pendere, si vellet caput
  </p>
  <p>
   a Lemuribus salvum domum referre. Tum incipiunt deambulare. Multisque spatiis jam
  </p>
  <p>
   factis, ecce tibi Stylius adest. Prior Plusius eum aspicit, atque illico laetus exclamat:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Venit!’ Eunt illi obviam, reditum gratulantur, salvum eum esse jubent, ad coenam
  </p>
  <p>
   vocant. At Stylius commoto similis: ‘Itane, Offuscate? inquit. Sed ludis me ludo meo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jam non est quod tibi succenseam; ego quoque te olim ad eundem ludificatus sum
  </p>
  <p>
   modum.’ Quae cum ab eo dicerentur, Plusius Offuscato accedens, summisse: ‘O virum
  </p>
  <p>
   summum, ajebat, atque praestantem! O singularem hominem, ac prope divinum!’ Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   post mutuas salutationes omnes simul sese Stylio comites addunt. Sed cum videt
  </p>
  <p>
   Plusius in via, ubi quisque Stylium aspiciat, ire eidem obviam ac venisse eum salvum
  </p>
  <p>
   gaudere, obstupescere; Offuscato latus fodere, et in aurem: ‘O virum maximum!’ dicere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Offuscatus, id se moleste assimulans ferre: ‘Parce, inquit, voci, nec me eas perditum.’
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum Plusius: ‘Ne time; egone, ait, ut capitis hominem mihi amicissimum, et tali virtute
  </p>
  <p>
   praeditum, perdam?438 Me satius est mori.’ Ne longum faciam, adeo Plusius haec sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   437 Cf. Ter. Eun. II.ii.241: “Simul consilium cum re amisti?”
  </p>
  <p>
   438 Plaut. Mil. II.iv.370-1: “ego stulta et mora multum / quae cum hoc insano fabuler, quem pol ego capitis
  </p>
  <p>
   / perdam.”
  </p>
  <p>
   222
  </p>
  <p>
   vera esse persuaserat, ut Croesi divitias cum thesauris sibi a Manibus commonstrandis
  </p>
  <p>
   non permutasset. Sed, qua homo garrulitate est, non potuit se continere, quin rem
  </p>
  <p>
   totam amico cuidam suo aperiret, qui Stylium optime nosset eundemque pridie ejus diei,
  </p>
  <p>
   quo Plusius haec a se visa narrabat, conspicatus fuisset. Atque ille continuo homini
  </p>
  <p>
   data esse verba439 intellexit, coepitque eum acriter objurgare, quod id aetatis homo,
  </p>
  <p>
   eoque ingenii acumine praeditus, duobus adolescentibus se irridendum praebuisset, ac,
  </p>
  <p>
   si pergeret credere, prope esse, ut ipsum lapidibus pueri insectarentur. Quod ubi
  </p>
  <p>
   audivit, adeo vehementer exarsit, ut propemodum ex ore flammas evomeret; ac sicam
  </p>
  <p>
   rapere, minitari absenti Offuscato; seque vel medio eum in foro obtruncaturum
  </p>
  <p>
   asserere. Ego, ad eum placandum interpres datus, vix orsus eram loqui de
  </p>
  <p>
   conditionibus pacis, cum mihi orationem eripuit ac: ‘Tace, inquit. Egone ut redeam cum
  </p>
  <p>
   illo in gratiam? Dii me perdant, si mihi erit amicus. Jam apud me tesseram fregit.440
  </p>
  <p>
   Abeat, quaerat alium quem ludat.’ Ego cum hanc viam obseptam viderem, coepi alia
  </p>
  <p>
   eum aggredi, ac: ‘Vide, inquam, tua isthaec pertinacia te potius quam inimicum perdit.
  </p>
  <p>
   An nescis quantam tibi potationem, saturitatem, et gaudium eripias? Nam promisit, si te
  </p>
  <p>
   sibi placarem, opiparam se tibi coenam hodie in qua velles popina daturum.’ Neque
  </p>
  <p>
   haec me ratio fefellit. Nam vix popinae coenaeque mentio injecta est, cum homo alieni
  </p>
  <p>
   cupidus cibi,441 et in primis popino, benigne gratiam fecit ne iratus esset, et quo vellem
  </p>
  <p>
   se descensurum spopondit.
  </p>
  <p>
   439 verba dare (alicui): to give empty words, i. e. to deceive, cheat.
  </p>
  <p>
   440 tesseram frangere (or confringere): to break a friendship; cf. Plaut. Cist. II.vii.503: “hic apud nos iam,
  </p>
  <p>
   Alcesimarche, confregisti tesseram.”
  </p>
  <p>
   441 cibus alienus: food on someone else’s dime or at someone else’s cost; cf. Ter. Eun. II.ii.265: “Viden
  </p>
  <p>
   otium et cibus quid faciat alienus?”
  </p>
  <p>
   223
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed properandum est mihi ad Thaumantium bibliopolam, in cujus tabernam
  </p>
  <p>
   litterati fere omnes saepe conveniunt. Eo enim venturus dicitur insignis philosophus,
  </p>
  <p>
   quem vos non nostis; cui singulare ingenium, summa humanarum divinarumque rerum
  </p>
  <p>
   scientia, praeterea dicendi vis egregia, ac memoria plane prodigiosa. Teratis cognomen
  </p>
  <p>
   invenit; jamque ab omnibus Teras appellatur. Hic bibliopolis imperat nec, absque illius
  </p>
  <p>
   permissu, aliquod scriptorum genus edi, aut venale haberi, aut importari in hanc urbem
  </p>
  <p>
   potest. Eo illum rogatum, ut amico huic meo, quem videtis, insignis cujusdam voluminis
  </p>
  <p>
   edendi potestatem faciat. Et, quoniam taberna illa propius abest a portu, non arbitror a
  </p>
  <p>
   rationibus vestris alienum, vos illuc venire; quo, cum nunciatum fuerit navim solvi, nihil
  </p>
  <p>
   in vobis sit morae.” Tum amicus ille, qui erat librum editurus: “Quoniam, inquit, Plusii
  </p>
  <p>
   mentio facta est, volo, si non sit odio, vobis exponere quemadmodum illi nuper a
  </p>
  <p>
   duobus sycophantis manus adita sit de pauculis aureis nummis, quos unicum egestatis
  </p>
  <p>
   sui praesidium ad extremos sibi casus reservaverat. Hi sycophantae, quos dixi, forma
  </p>
  <p>
   insignem puerum nacti, primum corporis obsequio sibi devinxerant442; tum quaestus sui
  </p>
  <p>
   gratia ad omnes sycophantias et dolos probe formaverant. Hunc in triviis atque plateis
  </p>
  <p>
   praeire jubebant; praeeuntem furtim ipsi subsequebantur. Puer, ita ut erat edoctus, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   quemquam offenderat quem, de facie, a puerorum concubitu non abhorrere existimaret,
  </p>
  <p>
   ita salvere eum jubebat. Rogabatque, ut aliquem sibi ostenderet, qui se in servitutem
  </p>
  <p>
   reciperet. Etenim, domi suae nobilem, patris saevitia eo redactum esse, ut patriam
  </p>
  <p>
   fugeret, summaque cum inopia conflictaretur, et jam diem unum sine cibo agere. Ille,
  </p>
  <p>
   tum misericordia, tum pueri specie captus, sequi se illum jubebat; ac simul ac cum eo
  </p>
  <p>
   442 Curt. X.I.25-26: “Bagoae spadoni, qui Alexandrum obsequio corporis devinxerat sibi, nullum honorem
  </p>
  <p>
   habuit.”
  </p>
  <p>
   224
  </p>
  <p>
   domum intraverat, introrumpebant illi etiam. Quorum adventu puer, ut erat praeceptum,
  </p>
  <p>
   ligulas solvebat, sibique femoralia443 ad pedes ire sinebat. Tum illi, clamore sublato:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Itane, ajebant, tu fratrem nostrum natu minimum ad nequitiam trahis? Evocate huc
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquis lictores, qui vinctum hunc ad tresviros trahant!’ (Nam pueris liberis commisceri444
  </p>
  <p>
   nefas hic grande habetur.) Alter vero: ‘Quid est opus, ajebat, lictoribus? Egomet
  </p>
  <p>
   lictorum, ego judicis, ego carnificis partes suscipiam, et corruptorem hunc, ut par est,
  </p>
  <p>
   obtruncabo.’ Tum vicissim conversus ad puerum, patria quadam severitate: ‘Non te
  </p>
  <p>
   pudet, ajebat, tam insignem generi nostro notam inurere? Cedo, quid te ad hanc
  </p>
  <p>
   turpitudinem adigit? Num fames? An non suppetit tibi domi nostrae affatim quod edas
  </p>
  <p>
   ac bibas? Abi domum, mastigia; nisi tibi dorsum virgis despoliavero, Jovem quaeso ut
  </p>
  <p>
   mihi sit semper iratus.’ At ille miser, inter sacrum et saxum positus, quo judicium vel
  </p>
  <p>
   mortem effugeret, cogebatur se pecunia redimere. Hoc rete capti sunt multi, sed unus in
  </p>
  <p>
   primis, ex insigni philosophorum familia, quem non est necesse nominare. Hic malacum
  </p>
  <p>
   pallium,445 vestem lineam, ac multos praeterea nummos aureos passus est sibi auferri,
  </p>
  <p>
   quo se tricis illis impeditum expediret. Alter vero, ceteroqui vir bonus ac prudens, sed
  </p>
  <p>
   pueri illecebris in hanc fraudem inductus, non solum coactus est in praesentia nummos
  </p>
  <p>
   dare, verum etiam sancte affirmare, ut, nisi vellet indicari, quoties ab ipsis
  </p>
  <p>
   conspiceretur, quod de industria fiebat fere quotidie, toties senas se eisdem drachmas
  </p>
  <p>
   ad pedes projecturum. Plusius igitur, qua est in his rebus cupiditate, (nam saepe a

   famelicus piscis ex hac nassa cibum petitum accurrit. Quem illi eodem modo
  </p>
  <p>
   circumventum, omni auro quod habebat dispoliarunt.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Inter haec ad Thaumantis447 tabernam pervenimus. Ac multos ibi videmus
  </p>
  <p>
   dispositis in sellis sedere. Quos inter unus, corpore paululum obeso, magno capite,
  </p>
  <p>
   capillo flavo, ore rubicundo, versus nescio quos alteri, qui ipsi assidebat, recitabat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fusco huic esse nomen ajebant, qui nuper Heroidarum quarundam epistolas Ovidii ad
  </p>
  <p>
   exemplum ediderat. Alii duo inter se de quodam adolescente, Pusillo Caesari nomine,
  </p>
  <p>
   tabe paulo ante consumpto commemorabant. Quem ingenii magnitudine, rerum
  </p>
  <p>
   maximarum scientia, atque omnis elegantia doctrinae, cum altero nescio quo
  </p>
  <p>
   conferebant; qui itidem ad miraculum doctus cursum suum transcucurrerat, et, paulo
  </p>
  <p>
   supra hanc aetatem, in ipso aetatis flore decesserat. Sedebat etiam inter eos Uranius
  </p>
  <p>
   quidam, cui summa ab omnibus pingendi laus tribuebatur; ac praesertim artis delineandi
  </p>
  <p>
   primae omnium concessu deferebantur.448 Neque inter litteratos illos versabatur ut
  </p>
  <p>
   pictor, sed ut litteris praeditus. Nam eum esse astrologum, mathematicum, poëtam
  </p>
  <p>
   atque ingenii acumine et inventione non multis modo suorum aequalium, sed superioris
  </p>
  <p>
   etiam aetatis anteire constabat. Quanquam, ex invidentia, nonnemo ejus laudibus
  </p>
  <p>
   conaretur detrahere. Ad hunc allatae sunt ab Arido litterae, in quibus ille de Merlini
  </p>
  <p>
   cujusdam senis injuria querebatur, qui neque rogatus neque coactus, sed sponte sua
  </p>
  <p>
   446 The 1645 edition reads “in furto.”
  </p>
  <p>
   447 Note the change in the form of this bookseller’s name: above he is called “Thaumantium” (accusative
  </p>
  <p>
   form of “Thaumantius”), which means that the genitive form should be “Thaumantii”; “Thaumantis” would
  </p>
  <p>
   make the nominatve form “Thaumas” like the ancient sea god. See also IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n.
  </p>
  <p>
   10). Interestingly, a bookseller named Thaumas appears as one of the interlocutors in the first dialogue of
  </p>
  <p>
   Dialog. XVII, titled “Convivium villae Syrorum.”
  </p>
  <p>
   448 primae deferebantur: passive construction of “primas deferre,” to assign to the first rank or first place.
  </p>
  <p>
   226
  </p>
  <p>
   acetum pro flore vini veteris miserat. Hunc esse ajebant senem odiosum, malum,
  </p>
  <p>
   molestum, avarum, contumeliosum, stercoreum, quique femoralia urina ac stercore
  </p>
  <p>
   imbuta quotidie domum ad uxorem referret. Has ille litteras clara voce atque distincta
  </p>
  <p>
   semel atque iterum legit. Quo factum est ut etiam ediscerem, ac ne exciderent, meum in
  </p>
  <p>
   codicem referrem:
  </p>
  <p>
   Pictorum lux alma, vale, cui carmina Phoebus
  </p>
  <p>
   Dulcis et Uraniae nomina clara dedit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ut modo Merlinus ludos me fecerit, audi,
  </p>
  <p>
   Putidus ille, malus decrepitusque senex.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fit mihi Janiculi supremo in vertice collis
  </p>
  <p>
   Obvius, et tremula talia voce refert:
  </p>
  <p>
   Est mihi, si nescis, vinum quod vincere nectar
  </p>
  <p>
   Possit, et aetherea ducere ab arce Jovem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ac rogat, instat, clamat ne sua dona recusem,
  </p>
  <p>
   Hauriam et e plenis limpida musta cadis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Torrebat casu misere sitis aspera fauces,
  </p>
  <p>
   Improbus immerito cum mihi verba dabat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nullas necto moras,449 vacuam sed mitto lagenam,
  </p>
  <p>
   Quam plenam larga reddidit ille manu.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toxica, crede mihi, non vina fuere; nec ullum
  </p>
  <p>
   Tetrius in terris arbitror esse merum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Namque, putans450 vinum vacuis committere venis,
  </p>
  <p>
   Atque avidam sicco pellere ab ore sitim,
  </p>
  <p>
   Horrendum subito talos it frigus ad imos,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et prope, praecluso gutture, vita fugit.

   Hoc tamen ipsa domus reficit se pallida potu

  <p>
   Quaeris, tam frigido451 cur gaudeat uxor aceto,
  </p>
  <p>
   Et soror, et famulus, filius atque nepos?
  </p>
  <p>
   Scilicet hoc miseri firmant munimine pectus,

   449 moras nectere: to procrastinate, to cause a delay.
  </p>
  <p>
   450 The 1645 edition reads “rato.”
  </p>
  <p>
   451 The 1637 and 1645 editions read “rigido aceto” for which Mark T. Riley suggests this emendation to
  </p>
  <p>
   “frigido aceto,” since “frigidum” a much more likely adjective to modify vinegar. For example, in the
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient world wine and vinegar were evaluated for medicinal purposes on a hot-cold scale, with wine
  </p>
  <p>
   being hot and vinegar being cold (Wilkins 2015: 279).

   His lectis, risus est ab omnibus sublatus. Tum alter: “Audite, inquit, aliam comici ac stulti

   hujus senis ineptiam, vel flagitium potius, supplicio dignum. Cum paucis ab hinc diebus

  <p>
   in procoetone Bibuli Dynastae una cum aliis multis versaretur, dum ad eum
  </p>
  <p>
   intromitteretur expectans, lepida ac liberali forma452 adolescentem aspexit. Hunc, relictis
  </p>
  <p>
   ceteris, petit, aggreditur; rogat quid rerum agat, ut valeat, ut crebro scortetur; nunc ei rei
  </p>
  <p>
   tempus esse. Admonet ut meminerit non semper eam sibi, quae nunc esset, aetatulam
  </p>
  <p>
   fore. Respondet adolescens se quidem a morbo valere; sed aegrum esse a crumena.
  </p>
  <p>
   Propterea scortum fere nullum attingere. ‘Hoc igitur, Merlinus ait, te voluptate ista
  </p>
  <p>
   omnium maxima prohibet? Bono animo es; inveni quod ames; de reliquo meae erunt
  </p>

   partes perficere tibi ne desit argentum. Ego quoque adolescens fui; scio quid sit rumpi

   negat illa facere mecum mutuum, cui ne teruncium454 quidem sciat esse, ipsi quod dem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Id tibi, si lubet, ubi erit ocium, ostendam.’ ‘Vel jam est ocium, Merlinus ait. Eamus.

  </p>
  <p>
   scortum intus accumbit, pro foribus servat, et ex vetere crumena tres extrahit drachmas,

  </p>
  <p>
   228
  </p>
  <p>
   quas deinde scorto persolvit. Eas mulier tristis accepit. Nam ex Merlini locupletis
  </p>
  <p>
   hominis liberalitate longe majora expectabat. Verum, cum fere quotidie adolescens cum
  </p>
  <p>
   tribus ad eam drachmis accederet, neque ulla mercedis accessio fieret, diutius dolorem
  </p>
  <p>
   dissimulare non potuit, ac: “Me pol, inquit, ut video, diobolare scortum arbitramini, quod
  </p>
  <p>
   tam parvo conducitis. Nunc autem, ut meam sententiam sciatis, tibi, adolescens, edico
  </p>
  <p>
   nisi ad quotidianas ternae alterae coaccedant456 drachmae, huc pedem intro non feres.’
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum Merlinus, stomachans: “Propudium populi, dic, inquit, quantum temporis isthaec
  </p>
  <p>
   tibi opera praeripit, adolescentulo quam locas? Sane adeo est pauxillulum, vix ut queat
  </p>
  <p>
   aestimari pecunia; ne dum male drachmis tribus compensatum queraris. Tanquam si
  </p>
  <p>
   ignorem eandem te operam nummo solere aliis addicere. Vel si sit cara meretricum
  </p>
  <p>
   annona! Nil hodie est vilius. Alio igitur ibimus. Eoque lucrum istud quod negligis,
  </p>
  <p>
   transferetur; tu vero egebis.’” Nemo fuit ex eo conventu, qui hanc olidi et capularis senis
  </p>
  <p>
   in filiosfamilias sub patre parco et duro liberalitatem et misericordiam cum risu non
  </p>
  <p>
   audiret. Sed, cum unus effusiores ceteris cachinnos extolleret, injecit aliis curam
  </p>
  <p>
   quaerendi quid esset quod rideret? Qui rogatus: “Famulus ille, inquit, qui ab Arido
  </p>
  <p>
   litteras attulit, revocavit mihi in memoriam ridiculum ejus facinus, quo non facile
  </p>
  <p>
   quidquam dixerim me legisse vel audivisse jucundius. Quo tempore vafer ille Rufo
  </p>
  <p>
   tabellioni, qui postea decoxit, navabat operam famulus, drachmas ab eo denas in dies
  </p>
  <p>
   singulos accipiebat, quibus obsonaret. Sed, cum die quodam cum drachmis decem
  </p>
  <p>
   obsonatum, ut consueverat, isset, vidit in medio foro hominem, qui, Praetoris permissu,
  </p>
  <p>
   plenam sortibus urnam habebat. Cui, qui Fortunam experiri cuperet, tres drachmas
  </p>
  <p>
   numerabat, et sortem unam educebat. Itaque magna eum cupido incessit Fortunae
  </p>
  <p>
   456 Plaut. Curc. II.iii.344: “et pro is decem coaccedunt / minae.” See also Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 12.

  </p>
  <p>
   periclitandae; atque drachmis tribus ex iis, quibus domino emere obsonium debebat,
  </p>
  <p>
   persolutis, Fortunam invocat. At fit, ut sortem beneficiariam educat; quae videlicet
  </p>
  <p>
   pollubrum illi argenteum cum gutto dabat, minis decem aestimatum. At ille, pollubro
  </p>
  <p>
   guttoque relicto, minas pro eis novem accepit. Nam cui pecunia quam sors magis
  </p>
  <p>
   placebat, ejus precium decuma detracta persolvebatur. Precio igitur accepto, reliquum
  </p>
  <p>
   nummorum, quibus emere obsonium debebat, in proxima popina profudit, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   domum redire curavit. Rufus, cum multas horas expectasset, et jam meridies appeteret,
  </p>
  <p>
   neque ille appareret, iratus quod impranso ille sibi dies esset transigendus, mandat
  </p>
  <p>
   lictoribus, ut inventum eum abripiant, et in carcerem abstrahant. At ille ex pecunia,
  </p>
  <p>
   quam ex sorte redegerat, preciosas sibi vestes a chorago conducit; ac circumpedes
  </p>
  <p>
   duos varia indutos veste457 sequi se jubet; atque ita ornatos, basilice magnificeque ante
  </p>
  <p>
   officium Rufi se infert. Sed simul aspectus et cognitus est, Rufoque demonstratus. Qui
  </p>
  <p>
   surgens, recte ad eum properat. Ille contra pariter fert gradum, confert pedem,458 ac
  </p>
  <p>
   salvere Rufum jubet. A quo interrogatus quid illud ornati esset, respondet, ab homine
  </p>
  <p>
   sibi propinquo haereditatem, ad talenta videlicet quadraginta magna, obvenisse. Itaque,
  </p>
  <p>
   pro re, nitorem sumere, et gloriam pro copia. Rufus, cujus res tendere ad ruinam
  </p>
  <p>
   coeperant, in spem fortunae melioris erectus, tacitus intra se: ‘Dii, inquit, me respiciunt,
  </p>
  <p>
   si vera hic memorat. Sed oportet ita esse. Nam quid illi veniat in mentem hoc fingere,
  </p>
  <p>
   ubi nihil est lucri me fallere?’ Quamobrem credit, novas spes sumit. Nec jam facit
  </p>
  <p>
   457 varia veste: defined in a footnote to Ter. Eun. IV.iv.683 (Plautus and Riley 1909: 107) as “party-colored
  </p>
  <p>
   clothes” (i.e., variegated) with the note that “it was the custom to dress Eunuchs in party-colored clothes
  </p>
  <p>
   of bright hue.”
  </p>
  <p>
   458 pedem conferre: to come near or up close to someone; cf. Cic. Planc. XIX.48: “possum magis pedem
  </p>
  <p>
   conferre.”
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   convicium ut servo, sed habet honorem ut domino. It illi comes exterior459 in via. Domi
  </p>
  <p>
   suae hospitium praebet. Et, quoniam preciosa ipsi supellex nulla erat, stragulam vestem
  </p>
  <p>
   sericam, et conopeum item sericum, non parva mercede conducit. At, ubi blandiciis
  </p>
  <p>
   atque muneribus satis eum delinitum putat, talenta quatuor poscit mutua; quae
  </p>
  <p>
   propediem eidem se numeraturum promittit. Homo liberalissimus: ‘Quid ais, inquit,
  </p>
  <p>
   quatuor? Decem roga. Nam gestio promittere. Quae, cum tibi erit commodum, reddes.’
  </p>
  <p>
   Rufus, ex laetitia vix sui compos, laetari, ac diis gratias agere, quod rebus suis
  </p>
  <p>
   desperatis ac perditis tam praesens auxilium obtulissent. Et quo magis obnoxium sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   hominem redderet, ac de decem talentis fidem servare compelleret, argentum foenori
  </p>
  <p>
   sumit, quinquaginta videlicet minas; ex eisque ornat ample magnificeque convivium.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dynastam Eugenium, tunc temporis opibus et gratia florentem, cujus patrocinio se
  </p>
  <p>
   tuebatur, ad coenam vocat. Convivales ludos exhibet. Comoedos, qui mimum agant,
  </p>
  <p>
   adducit. Licebat nebulonem illum cernere dynastae amplissimo proximum accumbere,
  </p>
  <p>
   assidere, crebro aliquid in aurem dicere, tanquam si esset par illi splendore, dignitate,
  </p>
  <p>
   potentia. Ea pecuniae vis inest. Quid verbis opus est? Minus quinque diebus
  </p>
  <p>
   quinquaginta illae minae dilapsae sunt totae. At nugator ille, cum aliquot jam dies ad
  </p>
  <p>
   Rufi mensam uberem ac plenam, sua ex sententia, se saburrasset, celocem460 alio
  </p>
  <p>
   direxit; et, die quodam, a prandio satur abiit e domo. Vesper adest, non redit. Unus,
  </p>
  <p>
   alter, tertius dies abit; nihilo magis. Rufus, qui jam explorata ac domi condita decem illa
  </p>
  <p>
   talenta sibi esse existimabat, neque uno nummo passus esset a se auferri, si quis
  </p>
  <p>
   459 comes exterior: to accompany someone by walking on their left side; Hor. Sat. II.V.16-7: “ne tamen illi /
  </p>
  <p>
   tu comes exterior, si postulet, ire recuses.”
  </p>
  <p>
   460 celox, ocis: literally a swift-sailing ship, cutter, or yacht, but it is also a humorous way of saying a full
  </p>
  <p>
   belly, cf., Plaut. Pseud. V.ii.1306: “unde onustam celocem agere te praedicem?”
  </p>
  <p>
   231
  </p>
  <p>
   emptor venisset,461 animum prorsus abjicere, conqueri, ac lamentari fortunas suas; sua
  </p>
  <p>
   sibi stultitia, quia hominem non asservasset, decem talenta fuisse erepta dicere. Sed
  </p>
  <p>
   octavum post diem, cum in officio suo testium quorundam juratorum dicta exciperet,
  </p>
  <p>
   ecce tibi homo solus, pannosus, ac sordidus, adest. Agnoscitur, ac Rufo in
  </p>
  <p>
   interrogandis testibus occupato statim ostenditur. Qui, relictis rebus omnibus, desilit ex
  </p>
  <p>
   scamno, atque hominem rogat, ubi sint circumpedes varia veste induti, ubi preciosa
  </p>
  <p>
   femoralia, ubi sericum amiculum. Ea ille chorago, qui locaverat, ut par erat, reddidisse
  </p>
  <p>
   respondit. Et simul de pecunia, quae ex beneficiaria ipsi sorte obvenerat, ociose ac
  </p>
  <p>
   lente narravit. Nunc vero redire, ut solita mercede suas ipsi operas locet. ‘Falsa sunt
  </p>
  <p>
   igitur, inquit Rufus, quae de quadraginta talentis, ex propinqui morte ad te perventis,
  </p>
  <p>
   commemorasti?’ ‘Tam vera sunt, inquit nugator, quam verum est solem media nocte
  </p>
  <p>
   lucere, vel mortuos vivere.’ ‘Cur igitur, Rufus ait, simulasti?’ ‘Quia, inquit, volui per hanc
  </p>
  <p>
   rationem experiri, qualis sit vita nobilium ac beatorum. Atque equidem suavem ac
  </p>
  <p>
   jucundam eam esse comperio. Vah! Quantum inest in ea boni! Divitem me esse natum
  </p>
  <p>
   oportuit. Nam scirem bene esse atque animo obsequi.’462 Rufus iratus, homini in os
  </p>
  <p>
   involat, ac plus quingentos colaphos ac pugnos infregit. At ille pulsanti os ultro objecit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed, postquam Rufum clamando verberandoque ad languorem datum videt: ‘Age,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, omittamus nugas; quin jubes me domum ire, quaeque opus sunt mihi depromi,
  </p>
  <p>
   tibi ut sit paratum prandium?’ Rufus, sentiens dum eum ferit, plus sibi nocere, destitit ac:
  </p>
  <p>
   461 Plaut. Men. V.ix.1160: “venibit . . . uxor quoque etiam, si quis emptor venerit.” I am assuming that the
  </p>
  <p>
   buyer in this context is a “bonorum emptor,” someone who purchases the debt of another (Berger 1953).
  </p>
  <p>
   462 Cf. Ter. Ad. I.I.30-1: “Uxor . . . aut te amare cogitat / aut tete amari aut potare atque animo obsequi / et
  </p>
  <p>
   tibi bene esse soli.”
  </p>
  <p>
   232
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Qui verberat, inquit, lapidem, perdit manum.’463 Tum placatior eidem factus, claves
  </p>
  <p>
   tradit et nummos, quibus obsonatum eat.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Delectati sunt omnes mirum in modum hoc hominis facto; atque eum nugatorem
  </p>
  <p>
   lepidum et sycophantam graphicum statuerunt esse. Jam omnes conticuerant, cum
  </p>
  <p>
   pictor Uranius: “Quoniam, inquit, cecidit mihi peropportune, ut in hunc eruditorum
  </p>
  <p>
   hominum conventum venirem, legam vobis, si placet, Phalaecium breve carmen Bibuli,
  </p>
  <p>
   magni Liberi Patris antistitis, jussu a me nuper effectum, quo columba, quae fuerat
  </p>
  <p>
   homini in deliciis, in ejus osculis et amplexibus mortua laudatur.” Cumque omnes se
  </p>
  <p>
   non nolle dixissent: “Sub haec, inquit, conditione legam, ut, si quid in eo titubatum fuerit,
  </p>
  <p>
   indicetis, vel corrigatis potius. Debet enim grandibus litteris marmorea in tabula incidi,
  </p>
  <p>
   ac parieti, una cum aliis epitaphiis quae ibi cernuntur affigi.”
  </p>
  <p>
   O factum male464 nequiterque, saeva

   Mors, quae quidquid adest ubique amoenum,
  </p>
  <p>
   Pulchrumque, ore petit voraciore.
  </p>

   Caram sic rapuit mihi columbam,

   Olim ut pessima Lesbiae Catulli

  </p>
  <p>
   Infecit lacrimis genas misellis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heu quo me dolor abripit gementem?
  </p>
  <p>
   Et quid facta queror rapacis Orci?
  </p>
  <p>
   Non ille id voluit nefas, nec ipsam

   Vix postremam horum versuum syllabam recitaverat, cum unus intervenit, qui:

  <p>
   “Venio, inquit, a foro, ubi Coschini Judicis prudentiam, justitiam aequitatemque supra
  </p>
  <p>
   modum sum admiratus. Etenim illi ejus judicio de re privata interfui, quo nec gravius,
  </p>
  <p>
   neque severius, neque aequius ullum Rhadamas471 vel Minos ipse fecisset.” Neque
  </p>
  <p>
   expectavit dum rogaretur; sed, attentis omnium animis, sic orsus est:472
  </p>
  <p>
   “Mulier vidua minas septuaginta exegerat, quas vicino cuidam suo, in
  </p>
  <p>
   mercimoniis quibusdam coëmendis occupato, multis ab eo precibus rogata, mutuas
  </p>
  <p>
   dederat, quas ille quartum post mensem se eidem remuneraturum promiserat, et
  </p>
  <p>
   syngrapham scripserat, qua mulieri, ut affirmabat, cautum erat. Verum, cum ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   pecuniae dies non advenisset solum, sed multos jam dies praeteriisset, neque pecuniae
  </p>
  <p>
   reddendae mentionem plus faceret, quam si nunquam accepisset; coepit eam mulier
  </p>
  <p>
   efflagitare. Ille: ‘Dabo mox. Post paulo. Redito cras. Nunc non est ocium’ dicere, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   diem ex die ducere.473 At, ubi se mulier duci diutius videt, hominem aggreditur et:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Quoniam a te ludibrio, inquit, habeor, pecuniam creditam lege judicioque reposcam.’
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum ille iratus: ‘Age, inquit, ut lubet; nihil a me tibi debetur.’ Itaque mulier curriculo in
  </p>
  <p>
   cujusdam tabellionis officium venit, ubi scribae aderant plures. Quorum uni rem narrat,
  </p>
  <p>
   et syngrapham tradit. Qua ille perlecta, risus effudit; ac mulierem jubet eam sociis

   472 The story about the widow that follows appears, almost word for word, as Exemplum CXLV (titled
  </p>
  <p>
   “Aequissimum prudentissimumque optimi ac sapientissimi judicis judicium”) in Rossi’s work Exempla
  </p>
  <p>
   virtutum et vitiorum. In the exemplum, the beginning of the prayer to the Blessed Virgin (salutatio Beatae
  </p>
  <p>
   Virginis), “Salve Regina,” is used instead of the Carmen saeculare. Because publicaction dates do not tell
  </p>
  <p>
   us anything about when works were being drafted, it is not possible to ascertain whether he repurposed
  </p>
  <p>
   the story in the Exempla for Eudemia, or vice versa. Suffice it to say that, as we have seen on other
  </p>
  <p>
   occasions, Rossi did not hesitate to reuse his own writing.

   inquit, isti sibi volunt? Quid rident? Atqui, si sedes et quasi regio ridiculi deformitas est,
  </p>
  <p>
   non adeo turpem me agnosco, ut rideri debeam.’474 Ad pauca ut redeam, ad
  </p>
  <p>
   tabellionem mittitur. Qui, re perspecta, mulierem fuisse deceptam intellexit. ‘Atqui noli,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, mirari si rideris. Tibi enim os sublitum est pulchre. Nam inficiator ille qui
  </p>
  <p>
   syngrapham scripsit, nihil in eam intulit, nisi Saeculare carmen Horatii, “Dianam tenerae
  </p>
  <p>
   dicite virgines.”’ Tum mulier flere, lamentari, deum atque hominum fidem implorare. At

  </p>
  <p>
   atque sapientia, aliquid inveniet, quo nebulonis istius fraus detegatur.’ Mulier exanimata
  </p>
  <p>
   accurrit, et ad domum judicis venit, commodum cum ille, litigatoribus a praecone
  </p>
  <p>
   dimissis, e tribunali descenderet. Accedit, injuriam sibi factam expostulat; narrat

   quemadmodum ab inficiatore illo pecunia dotali sit eversa, quam illi mutuam dederat, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   mercimonium ex ea coëmeret; genus etiam mercimonii, in quo collocata fuisset,
  </p>
  <p>
   exponit; syngrapham affert, quam deceptor ille, cautionis loco, conscripserat. Judex, re
  </p>
  <p>
   cognita, mulierem ludos esse factam475 pro certo existimavit; ac, sane commotus,
  </p>
  <p>
   bonum eam animum habere jubet, et in proximum cubiculum tantisper secedere, dum
  </p>
  <p>
   ludificatorem illum ad sese arcessat. Mittit igitur qui eum vocent. Venientem humaniter
  </p>
  <p>
   excipit, seducit. Rogat quid rerum agat, ut valeat. Ut merces, quam proxime coëmerat,
  </p>
  <p>
   lucro eum affecisset interrogat. Qui non male sibi negocium sub manus successisse
  </p>
  <p>
   respondit. Rogat rursum, num mutuum eam ad rem sumptum mulieri reddiddisset?
  </p>
  <p>
   Respondit ille se quidem mulierem nosse; sed neque illi, neque mortalium cuiquam,

   nummum ullum debere. Tum judex, prolata in medium syngrapha, quaesivit num
  </p>
  <p>
   chirographum suum agnosceret? Non est ausus negare, sed: ‘Quonam, inquit, hoc
  </p>
  <p>
   spectat?’ ‘Eo, ait judex, ut minas septuaginta statim dissolvas. Nam, si cuivis alteri
  </p>
  <p>
   tecum res esset, eundem paterer legis praescripto atque ordine agere, teque judicio
  </p>
  <p>
   non antea damnarem quam legitima omnia conficerentur. Sed, quoniam cum Diana et
  </p>
  <p>
   Apolline omnis tecum res est, pedem ex hoc cubiculo non feres, nisi eisdem, quod satis
  </p>
  <p>
   sit, facias.’ Sed, cum ille clamaret, seque iniquo judicio opprimi476 diceret, judex:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Evocate, inquit, aliquis lictores, qui vinctum hunc abstrahant, et sanctiorem in carcerem
  </p>
  <p>
   condant. Atque una opera rhedae equos adjungite; nam mihi Rex Sacrorum adeundus
  </p>
  <p>
   est, ac de improbissimo istius furto docendus.’ Tum ille, vinculorum metu adductus, et
  </p>
  <p>
   simul veritus iram Regis, si tam insignis fraus illustraretur, multis cum precibus
  </p>
  <p>
   impetravit a iudice, ut liceret sibi mulieri satisfacere; ac, missis qui pecuniam afferrent,
  </p>
  <p>
   eandem, cui debebatur, enumeravit.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Haec cum dixisset, quidam ex eo conventu petiit alte suspirium atque477:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Utinam, inquit, talem ego judicem sortitus essem. Non equidem in optima mea causa
  </p>
  <p>
   judicis iniquissimi sententia succubuissem. Erat mihi lis et controversia cum quodam
  </p>
  <p>
   Laurente de mutuo. Datus est mihi judex a praetore Cratinus, judex nequam ac levis;
  </p>
  <p>
   jussusque ut, si pareret, Laurentem mutuam a me pecuniam accepisse, nec restitueret,
  </p>
  <p>
   condemnaret eum. Planum facio testibus, me eidem pecuniam enumeravisse;
  </p>
  <p>
   chirographum etiam illius ostendo. Judex, rem sibi compertam esse, ac meridiana luce
  </p>
  <p>
   clariorem, fatetur. Verum opere me orat maximo, ut ipsum mihi iniquum ejurem. Cui

  </p>
  <p>
   237
  </p>
  <p>
   ego: ‘Quid ais? inquam; iniquum mihi illum ejurem, quem mecum sentire videam? Non
  </p>
  <p>
   aedepol faciam.’ At ille: ‘Ita dico quidem, ait; tu age ut lubet.’ Ego sine metu ac sine cura
  </p>
  <p>
   esse. Quid enim dubitarem? Res erat facilis; faciebant omnia mecum: jus, aequitas,
  </p>
  <p>
   judicis voluntas. Cum ex improviso nunciatur, pronunciasse judicem nihil mihi a
  </p>
  <p>
   Laurente deberi. Accurro; rogo cur tam iniquam adversus me sententiam dixerit, quem
  </p>
  <p>
   toties in hac causa superiorem esse affirmasset? Audite hominis impudentiam: ‘Jure
  </p>
  <p>
   tibi, inquit, hoc accidit. Quoties edixi ut me tibi iniquum ejurares? Erras, si credis, velle
  </p>
  <p>
   me res meas florentes affligere, ut jacentes tuas extollam.’ At postea comperi ex iis, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   fuere conscii, ea me iniquitate onerasse, ut ab homine potentissimo gratiam iniret,478 qui
  </p>
  <p>
   majorem ipsi in modum adversarii mei causam commendasset.” Sed cum judici maxime
  </p>
  <p>
   irascitur, factus est etiam commotior, repentino cujusdam adventu, quem nuper nescio
  </p>
  <p>
   quod volumen de illustribus sui aevi scriptoribus edidisse ajebant. Cui: “Non te puduit,
  </p>

  <p>
   tueri. Cui, dum pugnat, patinae argenteae duae mappa involutae, et ad zonam alligatae,

  </p>
  <p>
   puerorum excitatus est, ut sagittis eorum audaciam reprimeret, qui uni negocium

  </p>
  <p>
   patinas sustulit atque, omnibus ad pugnam intentis, se una cum illis e turba subduxit,
  </p>

   nec visus est uspiam. Pugna dirempta, placuit Gallonio et nobis ad portum accedere ne,

  <p>
   si ventus constitisset, navarcho in quaestione essemus.482 Ergo imus. Sed nondum
  </p>
  <p>
   tempestivum ad navigandum mare invenimus. Quamobrem, hortatu Gallonii, proximam
  </p>
  <p>
   Cereris aedem subimus. Ubi adolescens mulier, quam esse cerritam ajebant,
  </p>
  <p>
   adjurabatur. Illa modo se humi sternere, modo hac illac versare, tum ejulatus edere,
  </p>
  <p>
   spumas agere, atque deliramenta ejusmodi quamplurima facere. Medicus, curationi
  </p>
  <p>
   praepositus, a septem lemurum legionibus obtineri agitarique eam ajebat. Quos
  </p>
  <p>
   lemures certis quibusdam carminibus conabatur de corporis obsessi possessione
  </p>
  <p>
   depellere, Orcumque ire compellere. Illi contra obniti, repugnare, resistere. Sed demum,
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam cantionum earum viribus impares, se victos fateri; verum tergiversari, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   dieculam ad egrediendum poscere. Medicus negare, terrere minaciis; atque id unum
  </p>
  <p>
   instare, ut discessionem facerent. Qui demum, mulieris ore eruptione facta, egrediuntur.
  </p>

   Ac miserae, in exeundo, vomitum provocant; qui neque atram bilem, nec flavam, nec

  </p>
  <p>
   collocabat, populo aspiciendi potestas ut esset. Eaque mulieri, veneficae cujusdam
  </p>
  <p>
   opera, in melimelo voranda esse tradita; ac demum, vomitione excussa, unam tantum
  </p>
  <p>
   lemurum legionem secum traxisse narrabat. Reliquas cum aliis aeque portentosis rebus
  </p>
  <p>
   in ventre mulieris sibi castra munisse. Sed fore propediem, ut illae quoque suis socios
  </p>
  <p>
   vestigiis prosequerentur, quaeque adhuc venter intus prodigia concluderet, foras
  </p>
  <p>
   evomeret. Nos, rei novitate attonitis similes, non satis intelligebamus, quomodo
  </p>
  <p>
   melimelum unum tam multas res capere, vel eas mulier prudens, sciens, mandere,
  </p>
  <p>
   vorare, ac mansas anno post integras evomere potuisset. Quomodo enim acuum
  </p>
  <p>
   clavulorumque acumina nihil gutturi, nihil ventri nocuerunt? Quid? Clavum illum
  </p>
  <p>
   palmarem utrum minutissimas in partes dentibus divisum atque confectum in ventrem
  </p>
  <p>
   abstulit, an integrum voravit? Si divisum, unde ad ferrum comminuendum ea vis erat in
  </p>
  <p>
   dentibus? Si integrum, quomodo non est ab eodem strangulata? Sed hunc nobis
  </p>
  <p>
   scrupulum evellit unus, qui spectaculo aderat. Qui quidem: “Quam lepide, inquit, nebulo
  </p>
  <p>
   iste se nobis dare verba putat?483 Ut malus nos asinos, plumbeos, stipites, non homines
  </p>
  <p>
   retur? Tanquam si non sit palam unde portentosa illa defluxerint! Quod neque vos
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   istis celeritas manuum, ut, nisi admodum attendas, oculorum aciem effugiat.” Tum: “Tu,
  </p>
  <p>
   inquam, nullas esse cerritas, vel fanaticas, vel lymphatas existimas?” “Utinam, ait ille, dii
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   utuntur, hunc larvarum ac lemurum metum incutiunt, ac pecuniam auferunt, qua
  </p>
  <p>
   Hercules invocetur, vel Ceres placetur, vel olera aut alia ad suffitus faciendos emantur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alii, libidinosi, sumpta occasione, ad mulierum familiaritates sibi aditus muniunt; virgines
  </p>
  <p>
   ac matresfamilias saepe nobiles simulatione curationis attrectant, et, si fortuna vel
  </p>
  <p>
   casus conatus eorum adjuvet, etiam pudicitia denudant.484 Itaque, per hanc rationem,
  </p>
  <p>
   amores difficillimos atque carissimos sibi conficiunt, sine sumptu, sine molestia, sine
  </p>
  <p>
   dispendio.” “Vera loquitur vir iste, inquit alius, qui sermonem hunc auribus legerat. Et

   Quo tempore eram regi Alectrio a cubiculo485 (hic est rex vastissimarum earum

   cum muliere, in quam multa lemurum millia confluxisse jactabant, coeperuntque

  <p>
   suggestum, in foro sub regiae domus fenestras excitatum, ascendere. Atque ibidem
  </p>
  <p>
   mulier clamare, ejulare, hac illac se agere, in illorum brachia rejicere. Illi retinere,
  </p>
  <p>
   Herculem invocare, Cererem, Apollinem, Jovem, ut essent propitii, orare. Lemures,

  <p>
   injecto tantorum Numinum metu, ne tantulum quidem commoveri; sed obsesso in
  </p>

   corpore, tanquam in arce, majori se praesidio munire. Mulier, tanquam si ipsius ore
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   misericordiam commovere: mulieris inopiam afferre, cui ne pauculi quidem nummi, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   essent ad ejus diei coenam satis, adessent, ne dum suis opibus tam longam
  </p>
  <p>
   peregrinationem susciperet; proinde ad eorum opem confugere; orare ac deprecari, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   miserae subvenirent, zonam instruerent, ac viaticum ad iter ornarent. At populus sane
  </p>
  <p>
   commotus misereri, accurrere, stipem conferre. Illi gratias agere, pietatem laudare; ac
  </p>
  <p>
   se multa postridie, ac ceteris deinceps diebus, jucunda de cerrita illa daturos polliceri;
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   ut mos est earum gentium, tradunt se hilaritati jocisque; cantant, saltant, mulierem
  </p>
  <p>

   attamen, quia metus erat, si quid titubatum esset, ne doli aperirentur, coacta est
  </p>
  <p>
   saepius dictata repetere. Tum coeptum est cogitari de somno. Duo erant lectuli seorsim
  </p>
  <p>
   positi, qui, eorum opera, junguntur, atque ex duobus unus efficitur. Illi simul omnes sese
  </p>
  <p>
   commendant. His actis, speculator a rege missus, satis jam, satis rem esse claram
  </p>
  <p>
   existimans, quaerendi finem facit, atque abiit, ut regi, quae viderat, cuncta narraret. Qui
  </p>
  <p>
   rex gavisus est se opinione sua non fuisse deceptum. Itaque jubet omnes in carcerem
  </p>
  <p>
   condi, atque, habita quaestione, quae explorator viderat, ipsorum confessione proferri,
  </p>
  <p>
   et in publicas tabulas referri. Qui, manifesto deprehensi, non sunt ausi negare. Genus
  </p>
  <p>
   animadversionis cognoscite, et simul regis prudentiam admiramini. Imperat his ut palam
  </p>
  <p>
   in foro, atque ex eodem suggestu, quo populo fucum factum advenerant, palinodiam
  </p>
  <p>
   cantent, et tanquam cornices oculos cornicum effodiant.490 Quod si recusent facere,
  </p>
  <p>
   statim in crucem agantur. Ac ne saxis obruerentur, undique armatos disposuit qui vim
  </p>
  <p>
   populi impetumque repellerent. Illi, crucis metu, imperata fecere, ac postridie regis jussu
  </p>
  <p>
   exulare coacti, regni ejusdem finibus excesserunt.

  <p>
   sumptuosissimum, cujus erat olim aedituus Alexis quidam, spurcus homo et flagitiosus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hic, e numero quadruplatorum deterrimus, ac foedis puerorum amoribus notus, furti
  </p>
  <p>
   saepe se alligaverat. Praeterea decretam semper aliquam domum habebat, in quam,
  </p>
  <p>
   quidquid erat ubique lenonum, aleatorum, perductorum, conveniret, demum in quam
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes omnium libidines commearent. Nemo in eam puer pedem intro ferebat qui
  </p>
  <p>
   pudicitiam salvam inde referret; nemo in eam castus ingrediebatur, qui non inde aliquo
  </p>
  <p>
   pollutus flagitio regrederetur. Quibus artibus fiebat, ut omnibus carus in primis existeret.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed demum a duce lictorum clam veneno sublatus, est propterea quod falsum indicium
  </p>
  <p>
   ipsi detulisset. Cujus postea praetorem ac Regem sacrorum participem faciens, quibus
  </p>
  <p>
   id falsum esse constabat, habitus fuerat ab iis vel malignus, quod falsas criminationes,

  <p>
   exploratore cohors praetoris nullum neque meliorem, neque sagaciorem haberet. In hac
  </p>
  <p>
   igitur aede sacellum est Cereris perantiquum, ferreis clathris septum; maxima
  </p>
  <p>
   antiquissimaque religione praeditum, quod lapidem habeat inclusum, in quo sedisse

   expiandos magnam habere vim dicunt. Conduxerat per id tempus Uranius, nobilis
  </p>
  <p>
   pictor, tabulam quandam pingendam, in qua describeretur, quo pacto suae Dianam
  </p>
  <p>
   virgines, ex venatione sudoris ac pulveris plenam, sacro amne lavissent. Huic, die
  </p>
  <p>
   quodam, a mane ad vesperum, vox ex adverso clamantis aures verberavit, qui,
  </p>
  <p>
   completis sacris, et instante jam noctis tempore, nihil de vocis contentione remitteret,
  </p>
  <p>
   244
  </p>
  <p>
   sed eandem vehementius intenderet. Sensit Uranius vocem eam ex sacello prodire.
  </p>
  <p>
   Confert se illo, atque hominem ibidem inclusum, quid clamaret, interrogat. Qui:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Conductus sum, inquit, hodie ab Alexi, quindecim obolis, ut pro cerrito me geram, atque
  </p>
  <p>
   aedem clamoribus et ululatibus impleam. Ego ad ravim usque491 clamavi; neque homo
  </p>
  <p>
   adest cum mercede. Et quod molestius mihi est, ventris desiderio differor. Quod si
  </p>
  <p>
   cessat venire, et clathros istos recludere, hic profecto alvum educam.’ Tum Uranius: ‘Ita
  </p>
  <p>
   facto opus est. Age, ventrem exonera; et quod egesseris, cum ille venerit, ac te
  </p>
  <p>
   mercede pacta fraudaverit, in os eidem impingito.’”
  </p>
  <p>
   Haec elocutus obticuit. At Paulus Aemilius: “Ubi sunt, inquit, qui ajunt Romae
  </p>
  <p>
   tantum sycophantas et veteratores inveniri? Quantum audio ubique locorum moribus
  </p>
  <p>
   eisdem vivitur.” Interim veniens a navarcho adolescens, nunciat fluctus consedisse
  </p>
  <p>
   maritimos, ac statutum eidem esse navim solvere, et ad proximam insulam remis
  </p>
  <p>
   velisque contendere; proinde properaremus venire. Nos dicto audientes accurrimus, et
  </p>
  <p>
   navarchum cum chirurgo litigantem offendimus. Qui eum opere orabat maximo, ut se
  </p>
  <p>
   cum aliis vectoribus in navim exciperet. Navarchus recusabat, quod plena navis
  </p>
  <p>
   neminem praeterea caperet. Gallonius chirurgum rogat unde tanta haec navigandi
  </p>
  <p>
   cupido eum incesserit, qui semper a mari abstinuisset. Respondit patris saevitia
  </p>
  <p>
   contingere, ut patriam sedem exilio permutet, qui ipsum aedibus foras ejecisset: “Heri,
  </p>
  <p>
   ut scire vos arbitror, nos, qui vulneribus manu medemur, servi in crucem acti cadaver a
  </p>
  <p>
   triumviris rerum capitalium accepimus, quo ad remedia vivorum incideremus, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   viscerum posituram, colorem, formam ac magnitudinem pernosceremus. Ego jecur a
  </p>
  <p>

   quibus adnectitur septo, quod a praecordiis uterum dividit,492 diligentius contemplarer;
  </p>
  <p>
   illudque jecur rastro cubiculi mei parieti affixo suspendi; et, quia mihi erat negocium in
  </p>
  <p>
   foro, discedo. Aliquanto post cum prandii tempus jam praeteriisset, domum redeo,
  </p>
  <p>
   cubiculum intro, aspicio, neque jecur invenio; quaero ab ancilla, quid eo factum sit, et
  </p>
  <p>
   cur, me absente, ausa sit illud attingere. Hinc magnum mihi cum ea litigium exoritur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quo clamore excitatus pater meus eo venit, et: ‘Quid hoc clamoris est? ait. Quid vos
  </p>
  <p>
   velitamini inter vos duos?’ Ego: ‘Propudium istuc, ajo, jecur a me studiorum causa
  </p>
  <p>
   allatum sustulit; neque possum scire quid eo sit factum.’ Tum pater: ‘Quid clamore opus
  </p>
  <p>
   est? inquit. Ecquid mulier deliquit, si abstulit? Ut tu scias, coximus, ex eoque paulo ante
  </p>
  <p>
   fecimus prandio funus; neque alias esca una palato meo sapiit magis. Experire; tu
  </p>
  <p>
   quoque idem fatebere. Nam tua tibi pars in arca servatur.’ Ego, ex ira, vix mei compos
  </p>
  <p>
   (non enim erat ita facile jecur alterum invenire): ‘Elegans, inquam, facinus fecisti;
  </p>
  <p>
   crucifixi hominis jecur vorasti.’ Pater, qui nollet hoc sibi dictum, exarsit, ac: ‘Pessime,
  </p>
  <p>
   exclamat; tua causa factus sum hodie anthropophagus. Cur non antea dixisti? Cur illud
  </p>
  <p>
   palam habuisti? Abi hinc in malam crucem, et cave te mihi posthac ostendas. Quod si
  </p>
  <p>
   post vesperum in his regionibus conspicor, frustulatim differam ac mordicus tibi jecur
  </p>
  <p>
   abripiam, ut cum prandio coena conveniat.’ Ego patris conspectum veritus493 abeo,
  </p>
  <p>
   atque alias regiones persequor. Et, quamvis parce admodum viaticatus sim, facile
  </p>
  <p>
   tamen, ut spero, meo artificio me tuebor.” Non sine horrore et stomacho dicta
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescentis excepimus. Hominem tamen risimus, qui se humanis carnibus saturasset.
  </p>
  <p>
   Illum vero bonam mentem habere jussimus, et nauclerum oravimus ut in navim

  </p>
  <p>
   ad se Plusius attraxit, qui in crepidine portus lectitabat alteri nescio quod carmen; ac
  </p>
  <p>
   vultu et significatione videbatur eidem applaudere. Qui, ut nos aspexit, evocavit, atque:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Audite, inquit, lepidum carmen ab Arido Virgilio adolescenti missum, qui filius est fratris
  </p>
  <p>
   Ursati, magni antistitis atque dynastae, quem nuper extinctum deflevimus”:

   494 With the exception of the first line, this poem is identical to a poem Rossi dedicated to the real Virgilio
  </p>
  <p>
   Orsini, which is contained in a 1627 letter addressed to Giovanni Zaratino Castellini (Ep. ad div. 1.III.V).
  </p>
  <p>
   The first line of the poem in the letter is “Urbis Romulae spes nova Virgilii.”
  </p>
  <p>
   495 The 1645 edition reads “coërcitum.”
  </p>
  <p>
   496 artes liberum = artes liberales = ingenuae artes: the liberal arts

   497 Hor. Ars P. 404-6: “et gratia regum / Pieriis temptata modis, ludusque repertus / et longorum operum
  </p>
  <p>
   finis.” “Pieriis modis” is a reference to the poetry of Pindar, Simonides, and Bacchylides (see Horace and
  </p>
  <p>
   Fairclough 1926: 483 n. h).The name refers to Pieria, a Macedonian region that had a strong association
  </p>
  <p>
   with Orpheus and the Muses.

  </p>
  <p>
   501 IJsewijn’s note (Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 25) suggests that the Thracian harp-player referenced in this
  </p>
  <p>
   poem is Orpheus himself (“significatur Orpheus”), but it is actually a reference to the grandfather of Aridus
  </p>
  <p>
   Virgilius (pseudonym for Virgilio Orsini) the dedicatee of the poem. It is his talent that is being praised by
  </p>
  <p>
   this evocation of Orpheus.
  </p>
  <p>
   502 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 26) refers to Hor. Carm. III.3.1: “Iustum et tenacem propositi virum.”
  </p>
  <p>
   503 Hor. Carm. I.3.26: “audax omnia perpeti / gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.” See also Eud. 1998,

  <p>
   Lib. VII n. 27.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   descripsi, sexcenta possum exempla depromere.” Accipio et gratias ago. At ille eodem
  </p>
  <p>
   puncto temporis demonstravit digito philosophum, ex ea familia quae Minervae cultui se
  </p>
  <p>
   voti religione obstringit. Summa eorum hominum professionis haec est, ab uxoribus et
  </p>
  <p>
   ab omni genere concubitus abstinere. Unum sibi quotannis ex ipsis, magistri nomine,
  </p>
  <p>
   cunctorum suffragiis eligere, cujus imperio praesto sint ad nutum. Simili omnes vestitu
  </p>
  <p>
   uti. Una cibum capere, nunquam solos, sed binos, ternos vel quaternos incedere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Voluptates omnes respuere. Virtutes amplecti; eam in primis, qua Minerva se jactat,
  </p>
  <p>
   nimirum castitatem. Disciplina a Xenocrate, Platonis auditore, inventa ac profecta
  </p>
  <p>
   existimatur.505 Itaque ob hanc opinionem virtutis, honoris gratia, a cunctis illis assurgitur,
  </p>
  <p>
   deceditur, et tanquam praesentibus diis honor habetur. Iis licitum est, sine maleficii
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicione, in aedes nobilium introire; ad intima eorum cubicula penetrare; mulieres,
  </p>
  <p>
   absentibus maritis, invisere, alloqui, consolari; consilio, opera, et auctoritate juvare.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unum igitur ex istis nobis Plusius ostendit, atque: “Hic est, inquit, ille qui hodie
  </p>
  <p>
   intestabilis vivit.” Quaerimus quid sit hoc. Respondet: “Hic est philosophi illius comes,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui Pamphilam Lysimachi nobilis viri uxorem quotidie adibat ac, remotis arbitris, solus
  </p>
  <p>
   cum sola multas in cubiculo horas traducebat. Hic vero jejunus, una cum ostiaria, puella
  </p>
  <p>
   non illepida, in altero cubiculo servabat, ne alius adiret. Sed die quodam, defessus
  </p>
  <p>
   expectando, puellae inquit: ‘Dic, obsecro, quid negocii intus isti in cubiculo gerunt?’
  </p>
  <p>
   Quae ridibunda atque hilaris: ‘Quid putas? ait, se mutuo ad castitatem cohortantur.

  <p>
   505 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 29) refers to Cic. Tusc. V. XVIII.51: “Quid ergo aut hunc prohibet aut
  </p>
  <p>
   etiam Xenocratem illum gravissimum philosophorum, exaggerantem tanto opere virtutem, extenuantem
  </p>
  <p>
   cetera et abiicientem, in virtute non beatam modo vitam, sed etiam beatissimam ponere?”
  </p>
  <p>
   506 lolio victitare: to have bad eyes; Plaut. Mil. II.iii.321: “Mirumst lolio victitare te tam vili tritico.”
  </p>
  <p>
   249
  </p>
  <p>
   animo obsequuntur suo et sapiunt, mea sententia. Nos vero inertes ac jejuni eisdem
  </p>
  <p>
   excubias agimus. Cur idem ad exemplum nos quoque hilares non sumimus dies?’ Non
  </p>
  <p>
   fuit opus multis verbis, hominem et aetatis calore, et occasionis illecebris, et mulieris
  </p>
  <p>
   oratione incitatum ad nequitiam impellere. Sed veniebat illi in mentem professionis suae
  </p>
  <p>
   et voti, quo se Minervae obstrinxerat. Sed virginem plusquam se sapere existimans:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Alii, inquit, Minervae fidem, in eo quod promiserint, servent; mihi certum est
  </p>
  <p>
   occasionem tam bonam non amittere, sed ad id vela dare, unde flatus ostenditur.’507
  </p>
  <p>
   Atque una opera virgini in gremium illabitur. Neque id eo tantum die factum est, sed
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus deinceps diebus, quoties socius in cubiculo clausus navabat operam dominae.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sed tandem, processu temporis, virgini corpus extumescens fecit ut dominus, uxore
  </p>
  <p>
   praesente, ejus tumoris causam deposceret, et, cum res esset palam ac dissimulari non
  </p>
  <p>
   posset, flagitii auctorem exquireret. At uxor, cui plenum erat corpus fallaciarum et doli,
  </p>
  <p>
   quaeque nosset ancillae dedecus cum ipsius infamia esse conjunctum, iratae similis:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Vide, inquit, os hominis, ut simulat se nescire quod scit, nec fecisse quod fecit;
  </p>
  <p>
   tanquam sit obscurum ad quem tantum nefas pertineat. Tu, improbe, hanc culpam
  </p>
  <p>
   commeruisti. Me miseram, non posse me, domi meae, cujusquam vel ancillae, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   liberae, pudicitiam ab istius injuria defendere! Cum hoc me patiar esse in matrimonio,
  </p>
  <p>
   qui domi pellices habeat et uxoris rem negligat? Ideo ne tali viro nupsi, ut haec videam,
  </p>
  <p>
   et has contumelias feram?’ Ille, qui sibi esset conscius nullum a se virgini vitium fuisse
  </p>
  <p>
   oblatum, uxoris jurgio incensus, quo ostenderet nihil ad se crimen illud attingere,
  </p>
  <p>
   impetum in virginem fecit ac: ‘Mihi, inquit, indica cujus sis gravida.’ Sed cum illa
  </p>
  <p>
   dissimularet, ne cum alterius flagitio dominae praeterea dedecus invidiosa proditione
  </p>
  <p>
   507 Cic. De or. II.XLIV.187: “accipio quod datur et ad id, unde aliquis flatus ostenditur, vela do.”
  </p>
  <p>
   250
  </p>
  <p>
   detegeret, ardentius inflammatus: ‘Non potero, inquit, hodie a te verum exculpere?’
  </p>
  <p>
   Eductumque pugionem in virginis guttur intendit; et continuo eam se jugulaturum
  </p>
  <p>
   interminatus est, nisi indicaret, qui prior ipsi pudicitiam pepulisset.508 Quae tandem,
  </p>
  <p>
   mortis metu adducta, ab hoc viro castissimo se fuisse vitiatam exposuit, dum socium
  </p>
  <p>
   intus cum domina conclusum expectat. Ille tanquam Furiis actus, ad aedes
  </p>
  <p>
   philosophorum accurrit; magistrum appellat, flagitium in virginem admissum exponit, ac,
  </p>
  <p>
   nisi clamore et conviciis impleri totam urbem postulet, impurum illum tanquam noxam
  </p>
  <p>
   sibi dari contendit, quo ejus supplicio atque cruciatu dolorem suum lenire, et saturare
  </p>
  <p>
   animum possit. Magister suo ab alumno crimen depellere, ac peccare eum largiter
  </p>
  <p>
   dicere, qui tantam philosopho illi, viro sanctissimo, infamiam creet, quo nemo ea in
  </p>
  <p>
   domo neque frugalior neque castior inveniretur. Ille instare factum; magister negare
  </p>
  <p>
   factum. Sed, cum ille altius vocem tolleret, veritus magister ne concursus vicinorum
  </p>
  <p>
   fieret, ac facinus divulgaretur, blande hominem aggreditur, ac domum ut abeat rogat; se
  </p>
  <p>
   enim rem tantam inquisiturum, neque impunitam dimissurum. Qua ille oratione impulsus
  </p>
  <p>
   paululum iram supprimere et, quoad magister promissi sui summam expleret, expectare
  </p>
  <p>
   constituit. Interim philosophus, qui stupri fuerat accusatus, magistri jussu, in carcerem
  </p>
  <p>
   conjicitur, et poculum, ubi cicuta vino diluta erat, affertur, atque optio eidem datur ut vel
  </p>
  <p>
   illud hauriat, quo hausto, horae unius intervallo vitam amittat, vel testes demetendos
  </p>
  <p>
   exhibeat. Ille, subductis rationibus, satius existimans esse quovis modo quam nullo,
  </p>
  <p>
   testes lubens objecit. Aliquanto post, obducto jam vulnere, magister Lysimachum
  </p>
  <p>
   convenit rogatque, num de alumni sui innocentia certior sit adhuc. Ille audacter, nihil sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   508 pudicitiam pellere: take someone’s virginity; cf. Plaut. Ep. IV.i.541: “Plane hicine est, qui mihi in
  </p>
  <p>
   Epidauro primus pudicitiam pepulit.”
  </p>
  <p>
   251
  </p>
  <p>
   certius esse, respondit, quam ab homine illo nequissimo fuisse virginem vitiatam. Nec
  </p>
  <p>
   posse rem dissimulari. Tum magister: ‘Jam faxo intelligas quanto in errore verseris.’ Ac
  </p>
  <p>
   vervecem illum venire jubet et, praesente Lysimacho, vestes ponere. Quo facto
  </p>
  <p>
   nudatum genitalibus inguen aperuit. Tum magister, tanquam commotus: ‘Quid ais?
  </p>
  <p>
   inquit, hicne idoneus tibi videtur, qui mulieres praegnantes faciat? Quem inde a puero
  </p>
  <p>
   exectum, jampridem ob insignem vitae innocentiam Matris Magnae antistitem esse
  </p>
  <p>
   creatum oportuit? Tu posthac, cum agitur boni cujuspiam viri existimatio, linguam
  </p>
  <p>
   comprimas, si sapis, nec continuo falsis hominum de illo rumoribus aures praebeas.’ Ille
  </p>
  <p>
   his praestigiis profecto delinitus est, ita ut ubi esset nesciret, nec haberet in praesentia
  </p>
  <p>
   quid responderet. Quamobrem tum judicium, quod Minervae alumnum invidioso crimine

   Adeo delectavit me vafra illaec a509 magistro familiae suae existimationi hominum
  </p>
  <p>
   vindicandae suscepta ratio, ut non alias magis hominis cujusquam sagacitas et solertia
  </p>

   majorem in admirationem impulerit. Sed Gallonius: “Ostendam, inquit, vobis, si vultis,
  </p>
  <p>
   senem illum muccidum, qui acetum pro vino misit.” Respicimus ac videmus senem
  </p>
  <p>
   siccum, incurvum, rugosum, colore mustellino,510 capillo subnigro, neque ulla adhuc
  </p>
  <p>
   canicie infecto; qui meretricis de fenestra sciscitabatur, quid ipsi ab illis aedibus
  </p>
  <p>
   deberetur. Merlinus: “Aperi, inquit, te mihi est opus conventa.” Meretrix: “Non est, ait,
  </p>
  <p>
   operae in praesentia; cum amatore meo sum occupata.” Sed continuo Merlinus

   exclamavit: “Redde mihi argentum quod surripuisti, venefica. Ego te impudicam, non
  </p>
  <p>
   etiam rapacem, existimabam.” Mulier, flocci eum non faciens, abiit ac frustra litigantem
  </p>
  <p>
   reliquit. At senex nihilo minus clamabat: “Redde argentum, impura. Nam, nisi reddes,
  </p>
  <p>
   hic te pipulo differam ante aedes.”511 Gallonius accurrit, quaerit pro amicitia de eo, quid
  </p>
  <p>
   factum sit quod ita clamet? Ille: “Solebam me, inquit, a prandio, animi causa, in domum
  </p>
  <p>
   istius propudii conferre, ac pomeridianas cum ea horas in lecto traducere. Hodie cum ex
  </p>

   Liber VIII
  </p>
  <p>
   Ex omni hominum numero, qui erant nobiscum in navi, unum omnes adibant,
  </p>
  <p>
   circumstabant; rogabant quonam pacto Fortuna ita repente ex summis opibus
  </p>
  <p>
   redegisset ad incitas514 militem quendam, cujus nomen non memini, ex quodam
  </p>
  <p>
   honorariorum militum ordine, cujus ipse auctor extiterat. Etenim in iis regionibus plures
  </p>
  <p>
   ejusmodi militum ordines inveniuntur, qui “U” Graecum palliis assutum gestant ex
  </p>
  <p>
   serico, sive albo sive rubro, sive simplici sive argento auroque interlito, prout ordinis
  </p>
  <p>
   cujusque ratio postulat. Rogabant igitur, quanam sua culpa tam fortunato homini ex
  </p>
  <p>
   improviso fortuna terga vertisset. Qui respondit, neque illum fortunam unquam
  </p>
  <p>
   respexisse, neque latifundiis praediisque locupletatum fuisse, quorum fructus tantos
  </p>
  <p>
   illos tamque ingentes sumptus sustinerent. Sed mirum est, quomodo ita instructus ad
  </p>
  <p>
   malitiam fuerit, ut callidis consiliis ac dolis eam sibi vim auri paraverit, quae tam diu
  </p>
  <p>
   infinitis ejus sumptibus suppeditarit. Principio cum pedem intro in eam insulam tulit,
  </p>
  <p>
   egens, pannosus, alieni indigens, pane victitabat emendicato ab iis qui suarum
  </p>
  <p>
   coenarum reliquiis pauperum inopiam alunt. Cum ecce tibi, ex improviso, auri montes

  </p>
  <p>
   mercede conductas, Attalicis peristromatis ornat; penum, granarium, cellam vinariam

  <p>
   instruit; ex honestis hominibus familiam cogit; circumpedes multos varia veste induit;
  </p>

   quotidie exornat ample magnificeque triclinium; nullum vas exponit nisi argenteum;
  </p>
  <p>
   Cereales mensas dat, quarum reliquiis catillones515 se complures implebant. Quid

  <p>
   potestate, dat quaestori negocium, ut quaerat, investiget, inspiciat, num aurei illi nummi,
  </p>
  <p>
   quibus ille circumfluebat, probi sint an adulterini. Qui nullam interponit moram, sed una
  </p>
  <p>
   cum lictoribus hominem adit, aurum proferre jubet. Qui alacris profert. Quaestor
  </p>
  <p>
   nummos sumit; semel, atque iterum, ac saepius inspicit; ac nihil deprehendit in eis vicii.
  </p>
  <p>
   Miles, quo res clarior atque testatior existat, eorum non parum multos, atque omnes
  </p>
  <p>
   duplos, forcipe caedit, quo melius, si quid forte intus fraudis occultetur, appareat;
  </p>
  <p>
   eosque deinde, tanquam fastidiens, abjicit et colligendos lictoribus tradit. Quaestor ita
  </p>
  <p>
   discedit, ut eum et copiose ornatum et omnis fraudis suspicione vacuum arbitraretur. Id
  </p>
  <p>
   quaestoris arbitrium tantam illi divitiarum opinionem confecit, ut palam omnium ad eum
  </p>
  <p>
   concursus fierent, tanquam ad Midam, ut inaurarentur. Beatus sibi videbatur, qui posset
  </p>
  <p>
   illi aurum credere, quod paucis diebus post pulchre sibi foeneratum diceret. Augebat
  </p>
  <p>
   hanc de se opinionem sumptu ac magnificentia. Qua eatenus prodibat, ut certis
  </p>
  <p>
   quibusdam anni temporibus, praesertim Aphrodisiis, Veneris honoris gratia, cui ille
  </p>
  <p>
   militabat, puellis aliquot innuptis vestes praeberet; daretque operam omnibus rebus
  </p>
  <p>
   instructum paratumque convivium ut esset; ad quod non solum summates viri, amicique
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes, sed quicunque vellent, adhibebantur. Qua liberalitate in eam opinionem
  </p>
  <p>
   homines adducebat, ut pro certo crederent auri conficiendi rationem a plerisque
  </p>
  <p>
   tentatam, sed a nemine adhuc inventam, ipsum solum tenere. Neque ipse dissimulabat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam palam saepe multis audientibus dixit, in manu sua esse, paucis horis, nullo fere
  </p>
  <p>
   labore, auri massas, quantas vellet, habere. Neque dicto fides aberat. Etenim cum non
  </p>
  <p>
   parum saepe infiniti illi sumptus, quidquid erat domi, nummorum hausissent, ac ne
  </p>
  <p>
   255
  </p>
  <p>
   teruncius516 quidem unus vesperi superesset, postridie mane aureorum acervi in mensa
  </p>
  <p>
   conspiciebantur. Oris commendatio et naturalis quaedam virtus orationis, non parvam
  </p>
  <p>
   iis, quae dixerat, fidem conciliabat. Ea enim erat sermonis efficacia, ut videretur non
  </p>
  <p>
   posse obsisti. Praeterea tantos sibi spiritus, tantam arrogantiam sumpserat, ut par esse
  </p>
  <p>
   principibus postularet, summorum regum oratores prae se contemneret, ac principum
  </p>
  <p>
   civitatis affinitates appeteret. Qui hac fama impulsi, quod illi Juppiter de caelo aurum
  </p>
  <p>
   plueret, ultro etiam veniebant, ut gnatas ipsi suas in matrimonio collocarent. Sed ex
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus conditionibus Viae filia placuit, virgo formosissima, et regum etiam aliquot stirpi
  </p>
  <p>
   annexa. Jamque prope erat ut in viri manum conveniret517 (nam convenerat ut ne quid
  </p>
  <p>
   ea dotis ad ipsum afferret); quaeque opus erant ad nuptias aderant omnia: conopea,
  </p>
  <p>
   quae reges etiam ipsos decerent; rhedae serico constratae auroque contectae; varia
  </p>
  <p>
   vestis ac sumtuosa ad ornatum epheborum atque circumpedum; aliaque id genus
  </p>
  <p>
   quamplurima. In quibus comparandis aes alienum grande conflaverat. Quod ubi virginis
  </p>
  <p>
   matri oboluit (est enim ea sagacitate ut decipi non possit ), continuo, ex ipsa re, incidit
  </p>
  <p>
   suspectio: “Hem aes alienum contractum, argentum foenori sumptum, credita pecunia
  </p>
  <p>
   res emptae non cohaerent. Nam si fontes auri nosset, ut praedicat, nulla versura, sed
  </p>
  <p>
   praesens pecunia ad res emendas adesset. Profecto hujus magnifica verba, ni fallor,
  </p>
  <p>
   aliquid doli alunt.” Atque ab hoc suspicionis aditu ad ejus doli cubile ita pervenit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Creditores militis vocat; quid de eo suspicetur exponit. Dat illis consilium, ut praetoris
  </p>
  <p>
   516 teruncius: three twelfths of an “as,” or a quarter. I have chosen to translate this colloquially as a “cent.”
  </p>
  <p>
   517 in manum viri convenire: lit., to come into the hands of her husband. In legal terms, this signifies, under
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman law, a marriage “cum manu,” meaning that the woman comes under the legal control of her
  </p>
  <p>
   husband upon marriage (as opposed to a marriage “sine manu” when she remains under the control of
  </p>
  <p>
   her father even after marriage). I have chosen to translate this simply as “to marry.”

   decreto, tanquam si non sit solvendo,518 et fugam adornet, eum abripiendum in
  </p>
  <p>
   carcerem curent. Nam, si hanc contumeliam tam insignem in se accipiat, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   argentum promat quod illis persolvat, manifesta res est: hic merus est sycophanta. Illi
  </p>
  <p>
   consilium laudant, gratias agunt, curriculo ad praetorem eunt, desiderium suum
  </p>
  <p>
   exponunt. Ille, cui militis insolentia erat invisa ejusque immoderati sumptus suspecti,
  </p>
  <p>
   nihil illis est ausus negare; sed jubet ut ante noctem in vincula conjiciatur, nisi vel
  </p>
  <p>
   debitum integrum solvat, aut satis vel cauto det. Itaque ille miser lictorum turba
  </p>
  <p>
   circumfusum se antea videt, quam aut id leviter odorari,519 aut aliqua ad ipsum
  </p>
  <p>
   permanare potuerit; praesertim cum animum attendisset ad cavendum. Neque, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   socors et ignavus, se in eorum potestatem tradit; sed, educto gladio, conatus est ferro
  </p>
  <p>
   viam sibi munire ad fugam. Sed frustra. Nam a duce lictorum percussus in capite,
  </p>
  <p>
   coactus est consistere, seque constringendum abripiendumque in carcerem tradere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ubi paucos post menses, ex animi aegritudine, diem obiit supremum. Sed compertum
  </p>
  <p>
   est postea, nullas illi nuptias cordi fuisse. Unde enim uxorem, eo praesertim genere
  </p>
  <p>
   ortam, cum tanta familia aleret, cui nihil erat in terris ubi in in suo pedem poneret, neque
  </p>
  <p>
   aliud aurum vel argentum conficeret, nisi quod dolis atque fallaciis ex aliorum crumenis
  </p>
  <p>
   exprimeret? Sed solum, inquam, fuisse propositum, per simulationem nuptiarum, alios
  </p>
  <p>
   usque ad vivam cutem auro tondere, et in primis mercatorem locupletissimum magno
  </p>
  <p>
   adamantium520 numero circumducere, qui omnes erant talenta auri ad quinquaginta. A
  </p>
  <p>
   518 solvendo esse: to be solvent, able to pay one’s debts.
  </p>
  <p>
   519 Lactantius 7.1.11: “veritatem leviter odorari.”
  </p>
  <p>
   520 The 1637 and 1645 editions read “adamantium,” which I assume is a misspelling of “adamantum”
  </p>
  <p>
   because it is the solution that makes most sense given this passage and the rest of the narrative that
  </p>
  <p>
   follows (it does not make sense that the soldier wants to steal a group of admirers or lovers
  </p>
  <p>
   (“adamantium”).
  </p>
  <p>
   257
  </p>
  <p>
   quo si clam, precario vel simulatione emptionis, potuisset auferre; celocem habebat
  </p>
  <p>
   paratam, qua se in patriam reciperet ac fuga rem solveret. Sed inprimis ad eos
  </p>
  <p>
   avertendos usus est occasione conjugii atque nuptiarum. Nam ideo se velle eos emere
  </p>
  <p>
   ajebat, ut in veste uxoris Phrygio opere521 elaborata illigaret insereretque. Itaque
  </p>
  <p>
   frequenter ad domum mercatoris venire; phrygionem etiam cum particula quadam ejus
  </p>
  <p>
   vestis adducere; unumquemque adamantem in manus sumere, inspicere; experiri num
  </p>
  <p>
   loculis in phrygio opere relictis convenirent; dicere jam diem nuptiarum appetere; sed
  </p>
  <p>
   neque precium solvere neque certam solutioni diem praestituere; unum instare de
  </p>
  <p>
   tradendis adamantibus, vehementissimeque contendere. Mercator, qui eos invitus non
  </p>
  <p>
   haberet: “Ne unum quidem, inquit, ex his potest a me quisquam auferre, nisi praesenti
  </p>
  <p>
   pecunia.” Ille elate magnificeque, ut consueverat, loqui, ac: “Tu mihi, inquit, formidas
  </p>
  <p>
   credere? Cui alii sexcenta tanta soli enumerarunt, neque sunt decepti in eis. Neque est
  </p>
  <p>
   alter hodie quisquam, cui aeque recte credi homines putent. An nescis quod mox
  </p>
  <p>
   possum te auro totum obruere?” “Scilicet ita res est, mercator ait; non possunt aliter a
  </p>
  <p>
   me auferri. tua isthaec magnifica dicta hinc aufer. Nunquam enim me hodie inducent ut
  </p>
  <p>
   tibi teruncium credam.” At miles, ubi fidem suam sic concidisse animadvertit, continuo
  </p>
  <p>
   despondisse eum animum ajunt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tum unus, qui sermoni intererat: “Miles hic astu maliciaque victus est, inquit, a

  </p>
  <p>
   qua ea, quae dederat, eodem unde venerant reverterentur. Quae sane ratio feliciter
  </p>
  <p>
   cessit. Venit die quodam ad mulierem domum, perturbato similis. Quem illa continuo
  </p>
  <p>
   quid tristis sit rogat, quidve turbatus? ‘Quia, inquit, mihi litigium fuit cum aurifice, unde
  </p>
  <p>
   emi aurum quo te donavi. Qui quidem insanit de precio, neque quidquam523 pudet. Et,
  </p>
  <p>
   quia scit illud ad te advolasse, neque me posse reddere, litium terrore ad suas
  </p>
  <p>
   conditiones conatur attrahere. Ac modo, se mihi dicam524 scripturum ait; modo lictores
  </p>
  <p>
   et carcerem minitatur. Denique multis modis ferox est atque acer. Sed vin’ tu facinus

   lepidum, quo oculi illi doleant, facere? Redde aurum, quod dedi, ut sibi habeat; ita enim
  </p>
  <p>
   illum probe ulciscemur, si ea iterum venalia sit habiturus, quae jam se vendidisse
  </p>
  <p>
   crediderat. Tu interim hanc syngrapham collybisticam525 cape, nuper ad me domum

  <p>
   allatam; unde talenta bina statim accipies; quae vel in novis ornamentis vel, si magis
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   omnes longo intervallo relinquat; attamen majoris spe lucri, barbari hominis consilio
  </p>
  <p>
   superata est. Et continuo, accepta syngrapha, data omnia restituit. Quibus ille acceptis,
  </p>
  <p>

   Ubi, cum abesset a nobis propius, hominem inter lictores quatuor medium et catenis

  <p>
   quid quaeras. Sed quaerendi operam lucri facito; meae domi tuus est accipiter. Veni,
  </p>
  <p>
   sis; nihil est in me morae, quin statim accipias.’ Puer, cui nihil longius videbatur quam
  </p>
  <p>
   dum accipitrem suum recuperaret,527 sine alia cura aedituum praeeuntem sequitur,
  </p>
  <p>
   ejusque cubiculum intrat. Ille statim pessulum ostio obdit; ac misere multis precibus,

  <p>
   misellus ille in eas se plagas induisse cognovit, quibus nihil antea aeque metuerat; ac
  </p>
  <p>
   multis cum lacrimis orare hominem coepit,528 ut sibi haberet accipitrem, tantum abeundi
  </p>

  <p>
   excipiendum est.’ Horribilis ejus membri facies fecit, puer animi ut incertus foret, utri

  <p>
   529 honor (or honos) sit auribus (also, praefari or dicere honorem): literally “with due respect to your ears,”
  </p>
  <p>
   is a way for the writer to create distance from something distasteful in the narrative, like saying “pardon
  </p>
  <p>
   the expression”; cf. Curt. V.I.22 (a passage in which he is describing female nudity): “Feminarum convivia
  </p>
  <p>
   ineuntium in principio modestus est habitus, dein summa quaeque amicula exuunt paulatimque pudorem
  </p>
  <p>
   profanant, ad ultimum—honos auribus habitus sit—ima corporum velamenta proiciunt.”

   530 This passage is edited in the 1645 edition to remove the most salacious parts. There the passage

   regards to Rossi’s Pinacotheca, Herklotz (2008: 156-7, n. 34) cites an unpublished 1642 letter from Chigi
  </p>
  <p>
   to Rossi letting him know that, before Blaeu prints the book, the censor is going to edit the more offensive
  </p>
  <p>
   parts out: “si quid verbulum possit offendere lectorem, mutabit, aut praetermittet, cum sit vir doctus ac
  </p>
  <p>
   prudens” ([the censor], since he is a learned and prudent man, will change or leave out any little word that
  </p>
  <p>
   might offend the reader”). Likewise, Barthold Nihus informs Chigi in a 1644 letter that he has edited a few
  </p>
  <p>
   passages of Eudemia in order to get the book by the censors: “Ex Eudemia delevi aliqua, pag. 88 et 289.

  </p>
  <p>
   gratias agens, sine accipitre domum revenit; ac vix sui compos, ex metu, patri rem
  </p>
  <p>
   omnem, sicuti gesta erat, exposuit, ac: ‘Nisi, inquit, bonus ille antistes, quamvis

  </p>
  <p>
   primum diis, tum ipsi, se vitam filii referre acceptam533 ait, qui impuratum illum accersiri

  <p>
   se curaturum spondet, ne qua in posterum filio ipsius ab illo oriatur injuria. Neque

   objurgavit jussitque, ut statim atque accipitrem ad puerum retulisset, urbe illa, atque

   Nunc vero ad antistitem fani, quem expoliaverat, mittitur, ut ibi de eo legibus judicium

   Iisdem enim praeceptis teneras illorum mentes effingit quibus vos conatur imbuere. Et

  <p>
   etiam, ut concubitu firmiores eas nuptias efficerem, cum nova nupta me in cubiculum

  <p>
   quo profugisse eum ajunt, ut lege judicioque quod mihi sublatum est persequar, vel
  </p>
  <p>
   potius, ut praedoni illi animam adimam.” Cui Paulus Aemilius: “Nae tu flagitiose stultus
  </p>
  <p>
   es, ait, qui alteri malum pro bono, injuriam pro beneficio rependas. Tune satis pro merito
  </p>
  <p>
   gratiam illi referas,550 qui tibi uxorem, placidam tanquam ovem, reddidit? Non enim, dote
  </p>
  <p>
   freta, ferox esse in posterum poterit551; sed te in domini loco verebitur, metuet, atque
  </p>
  <p>
   omnibus tibi in rebus morigera erit. Deme igitur supercilio nubem552 teque una cum aliis
  </p>
  <p>
   hilarem praebe, ac, si me audis, domum revertere. Nam, si uxor tibi forma est luculenta,

  <p>
   Nam, et quod misere amabam, et quod crebrae adolescentium quotidie praeter aedes
  </p>
  <p>
   meas itiones554 reditionesque suspectam mihi reddiderant, ne latum quidem unguem

  <p>
   ceteri, sed domi, quod mihi affertur, curo atque ita suavitate condio, ut placere etiam

  </p>
  <p>
   me opere petivit maximo, ut se in aedem Cereris ducerem; atque ita apte elocuta est ut

  <p>
   persuaserit. Itaque circiter quartam noctis vigiliam555 surgo, Vulcanum in cornum

  <p>
   includo,556 atque ut me praeeuntem sequatur jubeo. Imus atque angiportum sordidum

   ac lutulentum intramus. Sedulo eam moneo ne luto vestigia defigat, atque: ‘Leonica,

  <p>
   inquam (id est illi nomen), cave lutum, cave lutum Leonica.’ Respicio; sed Leonica jam e

   conspectu evolarat. Ego exanimatus accurro, ut euntem persequar. Sed nugae. Noctis

  <p>
   Quod si aegre tibi illud est tamen, quod careas uxore, summamque557 in ea voluptatem

   Interim ex alto procul insula illa conspicitur,558 unde aedituum ex fuga retractum

  </p>
  <p>
   praestantissimum nascitur, emeret, et in navim imponeret. Accedimus, portum intramus,
  </p>
  <p>
   ibique adolescentem vita functum audimus, qui dynastae Vio fuerat in amore atque
  </p>
  <p>
   deliciis, quique ex maximis divitiis, quibus ab eo fuerat locupletatus, sua stultitia, ad
  </p>
  <p>
   summam sese inopiam atque egestatem adegerat. De hoc adolescente narrabant, cum
  </p>
  <p>
   olim ejus dynastae, quem diximus, domi honorarios inter ephebos559 aleretur, ac propter
  </p>
  <p>
   summam ejus superbiam insolentiamque ferri non posset, jussum esse domo illa
  </p>
  <p>
   egredi, et in malam rem, quantum potest, abire. Itaque ab omni ope desertum se in

   quotidie designaret, raptum fuisse ajebant in vincula. Sed ea, solita audacia, rupisse, ac

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   tentare fortunam, novasque amicitias experiri constituisse; atque eadem opera lembum
  </p>
  <p>
   conscendisse. Sed operaeprecium est intelligere quemadmodum Neptunus, qui nosset
  </p>
  <p>
   fortunam quam ille quaereret esse in ea terra quam linqueret, eum a mare repulerit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Evolarat jam e conspectu lembus, ventis operam dantibus. Cum Neptunus jussit
  </p>
  <p>
   Aeolum receptui canere,560 ac ventos navigationi illi secundos contrahere, vinculisque
  </p>
  <p>
   constringere, adversos autem solvere qui mare commoverent, eodemque, unde
  </p>
  <p>
   solverat, lembum impellerent. Ille, Neptuni imperiis obsequens, ventos illos e carcere
  </p>
  <p>
   eductos immisit in mare. Sed vix eruperant, cum, impetu facto, lembum invadunt, ac
  </p>
  <p>
   versoriam capere,561 seque ad relictas regiones recipere cogunt. Ad litus igitur ejectus,
  </p>
  <p>
   egens ac pene pannosus, quam spem aut opem, aut rebus suis consilii quid
  </p>
  <p>
   capesseret, non habebat.562 Aberat illis diebus dynasta Vius, ac villarum suarum
  </p>
  <p>
   amoenitatibus fruebatur. Verum aderat Styliolus adolescens, qui tum temporis apud
  </p>
  <p>
   dynastam illum plurimum auctoritate et gratia pollebat. (Nam eximium semper aliquem
  </p>
  <p>
   habuit ignavum, inertem, sine gente, sine nomine, cui praemia rei pecuniariae magna
  </p>
  <p>
   tribueret, locupletemque ex egente, neque tam dicto audientem, quam sibi imperantem
  </p>
  <p>
   efficeret.) Sperabat igitur, si commendaticias eo ab adolescente ad dynastam litteras
  </p>
  <p>
   accepisset, fore sibi in proclive quod cuperet. Itaque astute ac maliciose hominem adiit;
  </p>
  <p>
   atque his verbis alloquitur: “Emanavit in vulgus commeruisse me culpam, quam propter
  </p>
  <p>
   dynasta me domo foras ejecerit; idque magnam ea res mihi offensionem et
  </p>
  <p>
   560 receptui canere: to give the signal for a retreat.

  <p>
   562 The 1637 edition reads “quam spem aut opem capesseret, aut rebus suis consilii quid capesseret, non
  </p>
  <p>
   habebat”; I adopted the 1645 version because it is more succinct.
  </p>
  <p>
   273
  </p>
  <p>
   contemptionem apud omnes attulit. Oro, obsecro, ut mihi subvenias, et conceptam hanc
  </p>
  <p>
   nomini meo maculam deleas, quae omnes cogitationes, omnia consilia, omnes spes
  </p>
  <p>
   meas evertit. Te deprecatore, dynasta nihil denegare cuiquam audet. Scribe ad eum, ut
  </p>
  <p>
   mensem unum, neque eo amplius, me suorum familiarium loco ac numero habeat, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   elapso, ipse me pro expuncto habebo, ac, si per te licebit, quasi ab eo exauctoratus,
  </p>
  <p>
   tuam in domum, tanquam in aliam militiam, transibo tibique famulus serviam.” Homo
  </p>
  <p>
   ventosus gloriarumque plenissimus, gloriosum sibi fore putavit, si palam fieret homines,
  </p>
  <p>
   dimissa dynastarum familiaritate, quod apud eas gentes honestum in primis existimatur,
  </p>
  <p>
   in beneficio et gratia suam appetere. Itaque inflatum accipit; atque ad dynastam litteras
  </p>
  <p>
   dat, in quibus haec omnia exponit; et majorem ab eo in modum petit, ut exorari se sinat,
  </p>
  <p>
   et adolescenti animum expleat; nihil enim sibi gratius posse accidere, quam ut
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescens intelligat se ab eo tantum amari quantum ipse existimat. Obsignat litteras
  </p>
  <p>
   atque adolescenti tradit. Qui statim ad dynastam refert; qui tum ruri erat, ut diximus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neque dubitavit, aestate summa, meridie ipso, duodecim millium iter pedibus facere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dynasta, litteris lectis, ac vehementi illa commendatione expugnatus, exclamat: “Vincat;
  </p>
  <p>
   dummodo sciat, eum quem commendatum tantopere cupiat, quandoque suis rebus
  </p>
  <p>
   exitio futurum.”563 Neque ita multo post coepit omnem illi honorem habere; videlicet,
  </p>
  <p>
   ceteris, ut mos est illarum partium, honoris ergo aperto capite coram ipso stantibus, soli
  </p>
  <p>
   innuere ut se tegeret, soli sua consilia credere, soli rerum suarum fidem habere, soli res
  </p>
  <p>
   omnes, quibus aliqua inesset utilitas honorque mandare, illum in oculis ferre, solum
  </p>
  <p>
   adhibere convivam sibi, solum ipsi in cubiculo socium, in rheda proximum esse. Quae
  </p>
  <p>
   563 Suet. Iul. I: “vincerent ac sibi haberent, dum modo scirent eum, quem incolumem tanto opere
  </p>
  <p>
   cuperent, quandoque optimatium partibus, quas secum simul defendissent, exitio futurum.”
  </p>
  <p>
   274
  </p>
  <p>
   ubi Styliolus et litteris multorum, et sermone omnium accepit; sane, ut par est,
  </p>
  <p>
   commotus, scribit ad dynastam mirari se vehementer, quod adolescentem nondum sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   remisisset. Mensem enim jam praeteriisse, quo elapso, ipsi se ille quodam quasi
  </p>
  <p>
   sacramento obligaverat. Dynasta adolescenti litteras tradit; mandatque ut, quae sibi
  </p>
  <p>
   videantur, ad illius postulata rescribat. Qui statim Styliolo respondit, ejus se
  </p>
  <p>
   impudentiam, vel stultitiam potius, satis mirari non posse, quod tanquam a bajulo aliquo
  </p>
  <p>
   mercede conducto, suas ab ipso operas exigat, qui plures domi suae alat, honestiore,
  </p>
  <p>
   quam ipse sit, loco ac genere ortos, qui ipsi latrinam lavent. Quamobrem posthac
  </p>
  <p>
   cavebit malo, si sapiet.564 Nam, si pergit esse odiosus, sentiet quicum ipsi res sit,
  </p>
  <p>
   quemque hominem habere ludibrio postulet. Dynasta vero, ex rure in urbem reversus,
  </p>
  <p>
   data perpetuando, atque etiam exaggerando, majora in dies summi in adolescentem
  </p>
  <p>
   amoris signa praebebat. Cui etiam omnibus rebus instrui exornarique cubiculum jussit,
  </p>
  <p>
   conclavi illi impositum, ubi Styliolus cubitare solitus erat. Sed audite hominis insolentiam
  </p>
  <p>
   atque fastidium. Tanta illa apud dominum gratia ferox, totos dies noctesque saltando
  </p>
  <p>
   cursitandoque, eo Styliolum adegerat, ut neque somnum capere, neque alteri cuipiam
  </p>
  <p>
   rei dare operam posset. Is enim erat strepitus, crepitus, sonitus ut cubiculum una cum
  </p>
  <p>
   ea aedium parte supra caput ejus ruere videretur. De quibus injuriis saepius questum
  </p>
  <p>
   ad dynastam ivit. Sed non aliud ab eo potuit responsum exsculpere, nisi illum esse
  </p>
  <p>
   puerum; puerorum autem juveniliter exultantium lusus cum risu jocoque ferri oportere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itaque desperans simulque quod nimia pueri illius gratia sibi esset invisa, in ultima ac
  </p>
  <p>
   remotissima urbis parte aedes conduxit, eodemque tanquam exulatum abivit. Sed vix e
  </p>
  <p>
   limine pedem extulit, cum puer cubicula in praestantissima aedium parte, quae illius

  <p>
   fuerant, occupat, ac veterem ab eis possessorem in perpetuum excludit. Sed, quo in
  </p>
  <p>
   dies magis auctoritate gratiaque pollebat, eo etiam arrogantius insolentiusque
  </p>
  <p>
   efferebatur. Qua insolentia eatenus progressus est, ut olim in prandio, cum proximus
  </p>
  <p>
   dynastae accumberet, neque quidquam nisi pisces ederet (etenim, ex veteri earum
  </p>
  <p>
   gentium religione, eo die carnibus vesci religio erat), evenerit (fortasse quia valide
  </p>
  <p>
   fluctuasset mare), ut non quidquam fere piscium captum esset, quique aderant, care
  </p>
  <p>
   indicarentur. Itaque apponebantur illi pisces sane vulgares, sardae, soleae, mituli.
  </p>
  <p>
   Curaverat autem architriclinus, ut dynastae siluri libra carissimo empta anteponeretur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quod ille obsonium, cum praegustasset, ac suave recteque curatum offendisset,
  </p>
  <p>
   honoris et amoris ergo adulescentulo tradidit. Os hominis impudentiamque

  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   vitandi aestus causa, se receperat; cum Megalobulo, cognato suo, qui complura

  <p>
   oppidula dominatu regio obtinet, una ibi ut esset. Neque secum quemquam adduxerat,
  </p>
  <p>
   praeter circumpedes paucos, et adolescentem, qui noctu, velut corporis ipsius custos, in
  </p>
  <p>
   procoetone cubaret. At ille, nocte intempesta, nemine conscio, surrexit, et ad urbem
  </p>

   e lecto prosiliens circumpedem seorsum alio in conclavi excubantem excitat, lumen
  </p>
  <p>
   proferre jubet; ac copulati quaerunt, investigant, atque aedes inveniunt, foribus tanquam
  </p>
  <p>
   faucibus apertis, hominem foras evomuisse, quem, libidine incensum ac gestientem
  </p>
  <p>
   erumpere, intus continere non potuerant. Fit clamor; accurrunt alii, a quibus intelligunt
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescentem equum conscendisse, et citato in urbem cursu ad libidines suas
  </p>
  <p>
   explendas advolasse. Sed dynastam male illud urebat, quod abiens ille fores non
  </p>
  <p>
   obserasset, sed apertas reliquisset. Fuerat enim in potestate cuivis, vel inimico vel furi,
  </p>
  <p>
   usque ad lectum venire, ipsumque dormientem opprimere. Atque iratus cognatum
  </p>
  <p>
   Megalobulum vocat, improbum adolescentis factum exponit; enimvero hoc non esse
  </p>
  <p>
   ferendum, sed curandum, ait, ut intelligat quid sit principes viros illudere. Megalobulus,
  </p>
  <p>
   cui aegre erat in primis, cognati sui famam, ob nimiam gratiosorum suorum potentiam,
  </p>
  <p>
   malevolis iniquorum suorum sermonibus dilacerari, neque antea, ob ejus praestantiam
  </p>
  <p>
   dignitatis, ausus erat eum ut tantam infamiam fugeret admonere, continuo datam
  </p>
  <p>
   occasionem arripuit, atque hortari hominem coepit, ne posthac impuris ac plebeiis istis
  </p>
  <p>
   suam vitam existimationemque committeret. Sibi esse ternos liberos, forma atque
  </p>
  <p>
   aetate praestantes, quorum opera strenua atque fideli possit uti, si velit. Eos ipsi dare,
  </p>
  <p>
   donare, dicare. De reliquo sibi curae fore, ne tanta haec contumelia sceleroso illi, sicut
  </p>
  <p>
   et ceterae, procedat in numerum. Atque ita ab eo discedit, ut qui homines quatuor
  </p>
  <p>
   robustos, atque ad pulsandum verberandumque exercitatos, se inventurum dicat, qui
  </p>
  <p>
   advenienti ligna tanquam parochi praebeant566; adeo ut totos tres menses continuos
  </p>

  <p>
   familia quibus adolescens crudeliter imperabat, hanc ejusdem verberandi provinciam ad

   se receperunt. Neque aliud expectabatur, nisi ut rediret. Nam redeunti pro adventicia
  </p>
  <p>
   coena res mala erat parata. Cum ecce solutissimo animo redit, in atrium aedium se
  </p>
  <p>
   infert, recte ad dynastam intrat, qui una cum Megalobulo suavibus colloquiis
  </p>
  <p>
   pomeridianas horas traducebat. Illi, qui fustes jam ceperant, signum expectabant, quo
  </p>
  <p>
   homini caput, scapulas, et brachia dedolarent. Sed quid existimatis? Jussissene illos in
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescentem irruere, vel saltem eum graviter ab se increpitum suis ab oculis
  </p>
  <p>
   removisse? Vel, si minus tantopere saevire vellet, attamen tristiore vultu, quo se
  </p>
  <p>
   commotum intelligeret, aspexisse? Minime. Quid ergo? Accurrens irruit homini in
  </p>
  <p>
   amplexum, adventum gratulatur, atque: “Hodie appositus est nobis, inquit, in prandio
  </p>
  <p>
   pepo, quo neminem567 ante hunc diem neque formae melioris, neque succi suavioris,

  </p>
  <p>
   Megalobulus, statim rhaedam conscendit, et in sua se castella recepit.

   CHAPTER 3
  </p>
  <p>
   EUDEMIA IN EIGHT BOOKS: ENGLISH TRANSLATION
  </p>
  <p>
   Book One
  </p>
  <p>
   When the Conspiracy of Sejanus had come to light, and Tiberius’s cruel nature
  </p>
  <p>
   had erupted in all manner of savagery,1 I, Flavius Vopiscus Niger,2 together with Paulus
  </p>
  <p>
   Aemilius Verus, found ourselves caught up in the conspiracy as if enclosed within a
  </p>
  <p>
   Trojan horse. Fearing the emperor’s rage, in the middle of the night we secretly boarded
  </p>
  <p>
   a ship that was setting sail for Africa, so we could be transported to the remotest
  </p>
  <p>
   regions of the world where we would never hear of Tiberius or Rome again. But Fortune
  </p>
  <p>
   answered our prayers more generously than we could have hoped. We were carried
  </p>
  <p>
   along for some time on a peaceful and placid sea, but after ten days we began to
  </p>
  <p>
   experience its savagery and restlessness. All of a sudden, the sea rose up and raged
  </p>
  <p>
   so fiercely, with winds gusting furiously all around us, that it delivered us after a few
  </p>
  <p>
   months to a faraway and unknown part of the world, shipwrecked, almost left for dead,
  </p>
  <p>
   1 Tiberius, son of Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla, was Roman Emperor from 14 CE to 37 CE.
  </p>
  <p>
   His mother, Livia, divorced Nero and married Octavian when Tiberius was three years old, making him
  </p>
  <p>
   Octavian’s stepson. To further cement the family ties, Tiberius divorced Vipsania Agrippina in 11 BCE in
  </p>
  <p>
   order to marry Octavian’s eldest daughter, Julia. After Octavian took the name Augustus and became
  </p>
  <p>
   emperor (and after his own grandchildren had died), Augustus adopted Tiberius, officially making him part
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Julian dynasty. Tiberius’s legacy as a general was favorable, but he gained a reputation as a
  </p>
  <p>
   recluse, preferring to stay away from Rome and leaving the government increasingly in the hands of
  </p>
  <p>
   Lucius Aelius Sejanus, commander of the Praetorian Guard. During the 20s CE Sejanus accrued power
  </p>
  <p>
   to himself by eliminating opponents via a series of prosecutions and deportations, as well as by poisoning
  </p>
  <p>
   Tiberius’s son Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 CE. Sejanus encouraged Tiberius to retire to the island of Capri
  </p>
  <p>
   in 26 CE consolidating power in his own hands. Sejanus was elected consul with Tiberius in 31 CE, a
  </p>
  <p>
   post that came with proconsular imperium. Later that same year, alarmed at the extent of Sejanus’s
  </p>
  <p>
   power, Tiberius accused him of plotting a coup and ordered him to be arrested and put to death (OCD).
  </p>
  <p>
   2 The first and second name (praenomen and nomen) may be a reference to Flavius Vopiscus, one of the
  </p>
  <p>
   supposed six authors of the Historia Augusta, a fourth-century CE collection of biographies of Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   emperors. The last name may be a reference to the cognomen of Titus Petronius Niger, the real name of
  </p>
  <p>
   Petronius Arbiter, author of the Satyricon. Giachino (2002: 188) associates this pseudonym with the
  </p>
  <p>
   author of Eudemia himself, comparing the character’s chromatic last name Niger (black) with that of
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi’s real name, as well as his real-life pseudonym, Erythraeus (both meaning red).
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   and with our vessel in pieces. We collected our bags, in which we were carrying many
  </p>
  <p>
   precious stones and a large quantity of gold, and we made our way to shore.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first place we came upon was vast and deserted with no trees, structures, or
  </p>
  <p>
   cultivated land anywhere in sight. Soon fields began to open up before us filled with
  </p>
  <p>
   rich, green grass and adorned with all sorts of flowers. There were rivers coursing with
  </p>
  <p>
   pristine water, crystal clear lakes into which sweet water flowed—in some places at a
  </p>
  <p>
   trickle and in others in raging streams—and pleasant hills planted with vines and trees.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the hills was higher than the others, its lofty summit supporting a dwelling that
  </p>
  <p>
   was moderately sized, yet elegantly and pleasingly constructed. In front of it stood a
  </p>
  <p>
   mulberry tree whose branches spread out far and wide providing respite from the heat.
  </p>
  <p>
   That its owner had singled out that particular spot for providing peace of mind and a
  </p>
  <p>
   sense of delight was made clear from a plaque affixed to the outside of the home:
  </p>
  <p>
   Beautiful hills, the supreme delight of Bacchus,3 and beautiful farmland
  </p>
  <p>
   splendid to my eyes, fertile valleys, evergreen fields where a meandering
  </p>
  <p>
   stream flows down from mossy ridges, grant us this in exchange for our
  </p>
  <p>
   prayers: that our mind, having forgotten all evils, pass its pleasing
  </p>
  <p>
   moments of leisure in these peaceful surroundings. Our mind would not
  </p>
  <p>
   prefer the Elysian Fields,4 and the famous river flowing through that happy
  </p>
  <p>
   land, to you.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both the beauty of the place and our own weariness were calling on us, exhausted, to
  </p>
  <p>
   rest; but hunger and our desire to know under what sky we were, and what kind of
  </p>
  <p>
   people lived here, pushed us to keep going. We had barely walked three miles before a
  </p>
  <p>
   new sight revealed itself. Wild and uncultivated places covered in brambles and thorns,
  </p>
  <p>
   3 Bacchus (or Dionysus) is the son of Zeus and Semele. Originally a god of fertility and nature, he is
  </p>
  <p>
   associated with wild and ecstatic religious rites. As the god of wine he is thought to loosen inhibitions and
  </p>
  <p>
   inspire creativity in music and poetry.
  </p>
  <p>
   4 The Elysian Fields (or Elysium) is a paradise inhabited by the souls of the heroic and virtuous.
  </p>
  <p>
   283
  </p>
  <p>
   deep caves sunk into unbelievable depths with difficult and narrow access, sometimes
  </p>
  <p>
   from above, sometimes from below, and always precarious. But we managed to escape
  </p>
  <p>
   these hardships as well and reached a level field. We again found ourselves among
  </p>
  <p>
   wonderful flowers, unceasing waters, and tall green trees; at the far end of the field we
  </p>
  <p>
   saw gardens enclosed within a continuous stone wall. We read through a six-line poem
  </p>
  <p>
   that was skillfully carved in capital letters at the entrance to the gardens:
  </p>
  <p>
   Whoever you are who, tired, loves to look upon these steep mountains
  </p>
  <p>
   among which Lucania5 nourishes her beloved shepherds, do not be
  </p>
  <p>
   surprised that this place is rough with broken rocks, or grow weary at the
  </p>
  <p>
   dense thickets on the barren ground; because, indeed, the paths to such
  </p>
  <p>
   new and marvelous things should not be easily accessible.6
  </p>
  <p>
   The refinement and elegance of that place gave us hope that someone would soon let
  </p>
  <p>
   us know what country or region we were now dwelling in, so we threw our bodies, worn
  </p>
  <p>
   out from our long voyage, down onto the grass under the shade of many tall elm trees
  </p>
  <p>
   whose outspread branches were providing us cover.
  </p>
  <p>
   And our hope did not fail us. Not long thereafter we heard the giant bolts that
  </p>
  <p>
   locked the garden gates being drawn back and, behold, a man came into view. He was
  </p>
  <p>
   dressed in strange clothes but he had a familiar countenance that was clearly
  </p>
  <p>
   5 A region of southern Italy through which the Lucanian Appenines run, one of the southern subdivisions
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Appenine mountain range that extends along the length of the Italian peninsula. Ancient Lucania
  </p>
  <p>
   corresponds to the modern region of Basilicata, with the addition of most of the province of Salerno and
  </p>
  <p>
   part of Cosenza. The region was bordered to the west and east, respectively, by the Tyrrhenian Sea and
  </p>
  <p>
   the Gulf of Taranto; to the north by Campania, Samnium, and Apulia; and to the south it was separated
  </p>
  <p>

   6 This six-line poem, or hexastichon, is reminiscent of inscriptions on the portals of walled gardens in
  </p>
  <p>
   Rome that followed the custom of the Lex hortorum, a principle that gained prominence in the fifteenth
  </p>
  <p>
   and sixteenth centures whereby “gardens [were] created not only for the personal enjoyment of their
  </p>
  <p>
   owners, but to afford pleasure to their friends and even to strangers” (Coffin 1982: 202). This garden, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the ones described in Books Two and Ten, represent the sumptuous, elite gardens of Rossi’s Rome,
  </p>
  <p>
   such as the famous gardens of the Villa Borghese, Villa Giulia, Villa Medici, Villa Peretti-Montalto, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   Vatican. An excellent resource for viewing many of the elaborate gardens of Rome’s noble families are
  </p>
  <p>
   the detailed engravings in Giovanni Battista Falda’s Li giardini di Roma con le loro piante alzate e vedute
  </p>
  <p>
   in prospettiva (Roma: Gio. Giacomo de Rossi, 1670).

  <p>
   characteristic of a Roman. As soon as he saw us he looked up at the sky and
  </p>
  <p>
   exclaimed: “Thanks be to you, Sun on high, and to the rest of you celestial beings, for
  </p>
  <p>
   allowing me, against all hope, to lay eyes on these most noble youths, my countrymen,
  </p>
  <p>
   here in this place. But what fate has brought you here? Tell me straight away. I will
  </p>
  <p>
   assist you with any advice, matter, and aid.” I responded: “Tiberius’s cruelty and the
  </p>
  <p>
   Conspiracy of Sejanus, which was recently fully exposed (and which we were caught up
  </p>
  <p>
   in because of our involvement), spurred us to flee, and a storm tossed us onto these
  </p>
  <p>
   shores.” “What is this I hear?” the man said. “Sejanus conspired against Caesar? But
  </p>
  <p>
   Sejanus once considered me his closest advisor, placing me, his assistant, in charge of
  </p>
  <p>
   realizing his desires. I am Gallonius7 (my reputation surely precedes me), whom
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone loved because of my friendliness and sense of humor. But I grew weary of the
  </p>
  <p>
   City and resolved to move to Lisbon to live out the rest of my life with a friend. Five
  </p>
  <p>
   years ago, I packed up all of my most treasured belongings, gathered up my library of
  </p>
  <p>
   poets, orators, and almost all of the historians, and I boarded a ship.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But Neptune had it in for me as much as he did for you. At first he carried me
  </p>
  <p>
   peacefully on his back, but he soon began shaking me about like a fierce, unbroken
  </p>
  <p>
   horse bent on throwing me off. He subjected me to all the terrors of land and sea, finally
  </p>
  <p>
   7 Giachino (2002: 188) identifies Gallonius as the French humanist scholar Gabriel Naudé (1600-1653). I
  </p>
  <p>
   find this convincing because the name is a plausible reference to Naudé’s French origin (Gallus), and
  </p>
  <p>
   because Naudé had a well-known association with books being both a librarian—most famously of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bibliothéque Mazarine in Paris and as author of the first book on librarianship, Advis pour dresser une
  </p>
  <p>
   bibliotheque (Paris: François Targa, 1627)—and an active collector of books for his own personal library.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bianchi (1996: 220) transcribes an autograph annotation from a manuscript catalog of Naudé’s personal
  </p>
  <p>
   library from his time in Rome that reads: “Nota che alli 10 de settembre 1639, io haveva nella mia camera
  </p>
  <p>
   in Roma piu de 1600 pezze di libri” (“Note that on the 10th of September, 1639, I had in my room in Rome
  </p>
  <p>
   more than 1600 books”). Gerboni (1899: 132) suggests Antonio Galloni, priest of the Oratory of San
  </p>
  <p>
   Filippo Neri, as a possible identification, and the two manuscript keys I have examined (Appendix A)
  </p>
  <p>
   indentify him as Emiliano Griffone, who was a servant of Cardinal Peretti-Montalto, but I find these
  </p>
  <p>
   identifications far less likely than Naudé.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   casting me onto this shore, which was just as unknown to me as it was to you. As it
  </p>
  <p>
   happened, something not altogether unfortunate befell me because it is not possible for
  </p>
  <p>
   me to have landed in any place I would rather be than on this very island.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have found many men here devoted to pleasure and dedicated to gluttony and,
  </p>
  <p>
   as circumstances would have it, all of them Latin speakers, except for a few Greek
  </p>
  <p>
   words here and there. Indeed, at the time reported by Coelius,8 when Scipio Africanus
  </p>
  <p>
   was crossing the sea to Africa and was buffeted by contrary winds, they say that two
  </p>
  <p>
   triremes carrying Roman soldiers were torn away from the rest of the fleet by the force
  </p>
  <p>
   of the winds and brought to these shores. But when the soldiers disembarked onto the
  </p>
  <p>
   land, the inhabitants of this island welcomed them in a kind and gentle manner, allying
  </p>
  <p>
   with them at first through their hospitality and eventually through intermarriage. Finally,
  </p>
  <p>
   once they had become used to the soldiers’ language, little by little the inhabitants of the
  </p>
  <p>
   island forgot their own language and began speaking Latin. Their brilliant, natural talent
  </p>
  <p>
   was such that, when they set themselves to writing, they produced many splendid
  </p>
  <p>
   works, not only in prose but also in verse. When I arrived they were at last able to
  </p>
  <p>
   examine the writings of Vergil, Cicero, Sallust, Caesar, and other authors of this caliber.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now there is nobody on this island who does not own, read, or imitate these authors,
  </p>
  <p>
   8 Lucius Coelius Antipater was a Roman historian of the second century BCE who wrote a history of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Second Punic War. Here Rossi refers to a passage in Livy’s Ab urbe condita (IX.XXIX.27.14) in which he
  </p>
  <p>
   cites Coelius’s account of a violent storm that caused a fleet of the Roman general Scipio Africanus’s (c.
  </p>
  <p>
   236-184 BCE) ships to be blown off course to the shores of Africa resulting in much destruction. Livy
  </p>
  <p>
   specifies that Coelius’s account is unique (“Coelius unus”), since the other Greek and Latin sources he
  </p>
  <p>
   uses describe Scipio’s voyage as prosperous and free of such a violent tempest. Rossi chooses this
  </p>
  <p>
   exceptional account from Livy because it serves his narrative by providing a reason for why two triremes
  </p>
  <p>
   in Scipio’s fleet would have ended up on Eudemia (and succeeding in colonizing the island and teaching
  </p>
  <p>
   its inhabitants Latin), as well as setting up a parallel “historical” shipwreck story to mirror the storm and
  </p>
  <p>
   shipwreck that brings Flavius Vopiscus Niger and Paulus Aemilius Verus to the island two centuries later.
  </p>
  <p>
   See also Eud. 1998, Lib. I n. 1.
  </p>
  <p>
   286
  </p>
  <p>
   except for an inept few.9 The name of this island is Eudemia and it is part of
  </p>
  <p>
   Mauritania.10 Meanwhile, however, while I explain the customs and circumstances of
  </p>
  <p>
   this region to you I invite you to restore yourselves with food and drink, which you are in
  </p>
  <p>
   great need of.” Straight away, he ordered us up some sausages, cow’s milk cheese
  </p>
  <p>
   (both aged and fresh), loaves of wheat bread, slices of grilled veal, leftover capons, not
  </p>
  <p>
   to mention wine that was aged and of excellent vintage.11
  </p>
  <p>
   While we were lying stretched out on the grass, Gallonius said: “So, as I had
  </p>
  <p>
   begun to tell you, after Neptune had me in his belly for three whole months, he finally
  </p>
  <p>
   spit me out onto this land where up to fifteen dynasts rule with the highest honor and
  </p>
  <p>
   authority.12 They draw lots every year to select one of them to be king, and that person
  </p>
  <p>
   rules over all the others and holds the highest command over these lands. If these
  </p>
  <p>
   aforementioned dynasts were married before they were elected to that order, they are
  </p>
  <p>
   allowed to live out their lives with their wives and to enjoy all aspects of that life in the
  </p>
  <p>
   greatest abundance. If, on the other hand, they are not married, there is no longer any

  <p>
   9 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib I n. 2) compares this passage with Hythloday’s account, in the second book of
  </p>
  <p>
   More’s Utopia, of bringing his library of Greek authors to the island so the inhabitants could speak, read,
  </p>
  <p>
   and write in Greek after the best authors.
  </p>
  <p>
   10 Mauritania is a region of North Africa that corresponds to present northern Morocco and western and
  </p>
  <p>
   central Algeria north of the Atlas Mountains. The name of Rossi’s fictional island of Eudemia derives from
  </p>
  <p>
   the Greek εὖ δῆμος meaning “land of good people.”
  </p>
  <p>
   11 This is the first of many detailed descriptions of abundant, sumptuous meals in Eudemia, which are part
  </p>
  <p>
   of the indulgent society upon which Rossi is commenting. On the topic of the diet of Rossi’s Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   contemporaries, Laurie Nussdorfer (1992: 29) writes: “Seventeenth-century Romans ate comparatively
  </p>
  <p>
   well. One contemporary source [Teodoro Ameyden] commented that ‘Rome consumes twice as much
  </p>
  <p>
   meat and wine as Naples, although the latter city is twice as large.’ Romans’ mean consumption was
  </p>
  <p>
   higher than that of other Italians as well, and their preferred source of carbohydrates, wheat bread, was a
  </p>
  <p>
   sign of their ‘privileged diet.’”
  </p>
  <p>
   12 Dynasts, fifteen in number, are the ruling class on the island of Eudemia. They correspond to the
  </p>
  <p>
   cardinals in Rossi’s Rome. The leader of the dynasts is the King or Rex (sometimes called Rex
  </p>
  <p>
   Sacrorum) and is equivalent to the Pope. Like the Pope, the King is elected from among the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynasts/cardinals.

  </p>
  <p>
   need for them to consider taking a wife.13 On the contrary, if those without wives are
  </p>
  <p>
   found to have had relations with a woman, they are utterly and publicly disgraced.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreover, no one believes it is possible to conceal his shameful acts. Because those
  </p>
  <p>
   who commit these acts do not hold lowly or anonymous positions in society, but lofty
  </p>
  <p>
   and respectable ones, their deeds are immediately made public. Therefore, those who
  </p>
  <p>
   desire this honor hold themselves to the principle of the highest self-restraint, not
  </p>
  <p>
   exceeding the bounds of modesty in any type of food and clothing, not riding around in
  </p>
  <p>
   golden carriages, and eschewing attendants garbed in silk.14 They commit whatever
  </p>
  <p>
   money they raise from their priestly duties to the poor and they hold daily audiences
  </p>
  <p>
   with the public, during which they inveigh against the vices of their countrymen.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In particular, they strive to persuade their countrymen that a person’s soul is
  </p>
  <p>
   eternal and does not die with his body, and that something inherent within them lives on
  </p>
  <p>
   after death. They seek to convince their countrymen that dying does not involve three-
  </p>
  <p>
   headed Cerberus dwelling in infernal regions, the roar of Cocytus, crossing Acheron,
  </p>
  <p>
   Tantalus tormented by thirst and touching his chin to the edge of the water, the tale of
  </p>
  <p>
   Sisyphus rolling his stone, or the immovable judges Minos and Rhadamanthus15 (these
  </p>
  <p>
   13 The presence of both unmarried and married dynasts is likely a reference to the presence of both
  </p>
  <p>
   unmarried and married members of Pope Urban VIII’s court (i.e., they were not all celibate cardinals or
  </p>
  <p>
   priests). Carlo Barberini, for example (Urban VIII’s older brother), was married with children and held a
  </p>
  <p>
   high office in the Roman curia (Nussdorfer 1992: 34-35). The implication is clear, however, that the
  </p>
  <p>
   preferable status for dynasts is to be unmarried; being married is acceptable as long as the marriage
  </p>
  <p>
   predated becoming a dynast.
  </p>
  <p>
   14 This series of accouterments that the leading citizens of Eudemia do not possess is a commentary on
  </p>
  <p>
   the luxuries enjoyed by wealthy Romans in Rossi’s time, in particular by members of the ostentatious
  </p>
  <p>
   papal court. Rossi’s mention here of gilded coaches (rhedis auratis) demonstrates the spectacular
  </p>
  <p>
   presence of these vehicles on the streets of Rome in the seventeenth century: “Within the walls [of Rome]
  </p>
  <p>
   the remnants of ancient monuments made room for a promiscuous mix of vegetable stalls, great urban
  </p>
  <p>
   townhouses, taverns, and the newly arrived vehicle of conspicuous consumption, the coach” (Nussdorfer
  </p>
  <p>
   1992: 19).
  </p>
  <p>
   15 Cerberus is the three-headed dog that guards the entrance to Hades; Cocytus and Acheron are two of
  </p>
  <p>
   the rivers of Hades; Tantalus was punished in Hades by being made to stand in a pool of water beneath a
  </p>

   288
  </p>
  <p>
   are just old wives’ tales and extravagant fictions of poets and painters), but that the
  </p>
  <p>
   severest punishments for the wicked in the Underworld are certain and established. It
  </p>
  <p>
   sometimes happens that those who are devoted to this way of life beyond all measure
  </p>
  <p>
   are enlisted in the company of the gods after they die; priests build temples and altars to
  </p>
  <p>
   them, and everyone everywhere prays to them at their altars, making sacrifices and
  </p>
  <p>
   swearing oaths to them. Although they enjoy an honor so great that nothing could
  </p>
  <p>
   possibly be added to it, nevertheless, for those who are eager to achieve this godlike
  </p>
  <p>
   status, few people think that the gods look favorably upon such people, with most
  </p>
  <p>
   thinking that the gods are even angry with them; for they say that it is far better to
  </p>
  <p>
   experience a single day of the greatest pleasure than to live for generations in people’s
  </p>
  <p>
   memories.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Those with wives have a very different way of thinking. They are allowed to live
  </p>
  <p>
   as they wish, indulging in pleasures and carrying on with excessive spending, with the
  </p>
  <p>
   full approval of gods and men. It seems that they are permitted, with the money
  </p>
  <p>
   acquired from the substantial priestly duties they hold, to amass wealth, to hand it over
  </p>
  <p>
   to their wives to buy a fillet to wear around their neck or in their hair and to buy them
  </p>
  <p>
   houses or villas on the outskirts of the city, which they decorate with carpets worthy of
  </p>
  <p>
   Attalus of Pergamum16 and outfit with furniture made of gold (because silver is
  </p>
  <p>
   worthless here). To their carriages, which are lined with silk and inlaid with gold, they
  </p>
  <p>
   fruit tree, both of which receded when he reached for them; Sisyphus was punished in Hades by being
  </p>
  <p>
   condemned to roll a large stone up a hill, from which it always rolled back down; Minos, a legendary king
  </p>
  <p>
   of Crete, and his brother Rhadamanthus became judges of the dead in the Hades (OCD).
  </p>
  <p>
   16 Attalus I (269-197 BCE) ruled Pergamum from 241-197. He successfully expanded and consolidated
  </p>
  <p>
   his kingdom and famously celebrated his victories with monuments of spectacular expense and artistic
  </p>
  <p>
   quality (e.g., the Dying Gaul) (OCD).
  </p>
  <p>
   289
  </p>
  <p>
   yoke very expensive horses likewise decorated with silk and gold horse-cloth. Finally,
  </p>
  <p>
   they are all persuaded to commit themselves to cultivating splendid opulence whether
  </p>
  <p>
   they had reached that high level of greatness deservedly, or through ambition, good
  </p>
  <p>
   fortune, or chance. And they do this for the sake of their wives, who enjoy this status
  </p>
  <p>
   alongside their husbands. But all of the dynasts, both the unmarried ones and those
  </p>
  <p>
   with wives and children, resolve all public disputes together with the king, organize
  </p>
  <p>
   sacrifices, divide priestly duties among themselves, and use their enormous revenues—
  </p>
  <p>
   the majority of which they divert to their own private use—for purchasing sacrificial
  </p>
  <p>
   animals that they use for making sacrifices to Jove, Minerva, Apollo, and the rest of the
  </p>
  <p>
   gods, and for feeding their many attendants.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When he had paused a while, Paulus Aemilius, with his strength restored, said:
  </p>
  <p>
   “May the gods grant you whatever you wish. Never have I been so pleased with a meal
  </p>
  <p>
   as with the lunch you just served me. But this brings us to the question: Who is the
  </p>
  <p>
   owner of these gardens that the inscription mounted at the entrance promises to be the
  </p>
  <p>
   eighth wonder of the world?”17 Gallonius responded: “The man I work for does not just
  </p>
  <p>
   own these gardens, but also all of the surrounding fields. He is a dynast named
  </p>
  <p>
   Plusius,18 and he is easily superior to all the others in wealth, authority, and resources.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because I am especially devoted to cookery, an art I am considered to be extremely
  </p>
  <p>
   17 The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hanging Gardens of
  </p>
  <p>
   Babylon, the Temple of Artemis, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the
  </p>
  <p>
   Colossus of Rhodes, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.
  </p>
  <p>
   18 Cardinal Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto (1571-1623). The pseudonym is derived from the
  </p>
  <p>
   Greek adjective πλούσιος meaning wealthy (see also Eud. 1998, Lib. I n. 3). The lavish gardens
  </p>
  <p>
   described in this passage are likely a reference to the magnificent gardens of the Villa Peretti-Montalto,
  </p>
  <p>
   which was originally built by Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto’s uncle, Cardinal Felice Peretti,
  </p>
  <p>
   later Pope Sixtus V. The grand villa overlooked the Baths of Diocletian and its entrance stood where
  </p>
  <p>
   Termini Station is now.
  </p>
  <p>
   290
  </p>
  <p>
   skilled in, and because I am able to put together tasty dinners and lunches, he put me in
  </p>
  <p>
   charge of his entire household. I am therefore his butler, his steward, his majordomo,
  </p>
  <p>
   his taster, and his carver. These duties, which are performed in Rome by lowly
  </p>
  <p>
   servants, are entrusted here to freedmen and nobles. I oversee the cooks and the
  </p>
  <p>
   stewards. I punish anyone who is insolent or unreliable by docking part of his wages or
  </p>
  <p>
   food allowance—and no one dares say a word or even open his mouth.” Then Aemilius
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “If you have time, and if your master does not mind, show us around as much of
  </p>
  <p>
   the gardens as you can. By god, we would love to see them.” “As you like,” he said. “I
  </p>
  <p>
   am free now, and nothing better could befall my master, since it is not only the
  </p>
  <p>
   extravagance accompanying the great abundance of his possessions that delights him,
  </p>
  <p>
   but also the wide reporting of his extravagance.” But I was worried about the gold we
  </p>
  <p>
   were carrying with us and said: “Gallonius, please find a safe place where we can store
  </p>
  <p>
   these bags. We’ve been carrying them on our shoulders since we left the shore.” “Don’t
  </p>
  <p>
   worry,” he said. “I’ll take care of it.” When he picked up the bags he exclaimed:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Goodness, I say, these are heavy!” and he handed them over to the young men who
  </p>
  <p>
   were accompanying him to carry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once we were given leave to enter, the first thing we came upon was a level field
  </p>
  <p>
   that was flat, in the shape of a quadrangle, and adorned with many distinct sections of
  </p>
  <p>
   trees, flowers, and grasses. In the middle stood a shining fountain that had been
  </p>
  <p>
   fashioned to a great size and with astonishing craftsmanship.19 The entire work of art
  </p>
  <p>
   19 This is the opening of one of two ekphrases describing in great detail elaborately wrought fountains on
  </p>
  <p>
   the palace grounds of the dynasts. The presence of fountains in Rossi’s work is significant for a couple of
  </p>
  <p>
   reasons. Fountains play an important role in Baroque art because one of its aesthetic goals is to evoke a
  </p>
  <p>
   sense of wonder (meraviglia) in the viewer making fountains, with their elaborate sculptures and intricate
  </p>
  <p>
   waterways that add to the sense of movement, “veri e propri monumenti all’acqua e al movimento” (“true
  </p>
  <p>
   monuments to water and to movement”; Battistini 2000: 161). In addition, Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-
  </p>
  <p>
   1680) was active in Rome during this period transforming the cityscape with his famous fountains, which
  </p>
  <p>
   291
  </p>
  <p>
   was square at the bottom and round at the top, and it ascended, by way of four evenly
  </p>
  <p>
   spaced stairways, from the lowest part to the uppermost part, at which point there was a
  </p>
  <p>
   large base surrounded by many monsters where a huge quantity of water spouted from
  </p>
  <p>
   the marble and flowed around four figures of lions, and just as many giants, into a pool
  </p>
  <p>
   below; it then poured back over many lion heads, affixed to surrounding grates, into
  </p>
  <p>
   reservoirs below. From there the water was carried through hidden channels toward
  </p>
  <p>
   other lion heads, affixed to other grates that continued on a bit further down, to then flow
  </p>
  <p>
   back to the top. On the other hand, the lower part is separated and divided into four
  </p>
  <p>
   sections, which are the four channels through which the water reaches the top part;
  </p>
  <p>
   each one of these channels is made to look like one of the four seas. They are so
  </p>
  <p>
   realistic in appearance that, in the splendor of this flowing fountain, you seem to
  </p>
  <p>
   perceive, all within a brief period of time, the immense smooth surface and color of a
  </p>
  <p>
   placid sea. In addition, individual ships float around in each of the seas, spouting a thin
  </p>
  <p>
   veil of water, that looks like sails, from their masts and yards, while three Triton figures20
  </p>
  <p>
   pour forth water from a seashell horn. These figures were created with such artistry that
  </p>
  <p>
   you would say these vessels were not sitting still but were being carried about the entire
  </p>
  <p>
   sea, or that the Tritons were not sprinkling water from their horns but were gently
  </p>
  <p>
   blowing sound. I will not even mention the obelisks, receptacles made out of tufa, and
  </p>
  <p>
   other ornamental elements, with which all of the railings are encircled on all sides at the
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly would have made an impression on a citizen of Rome like Rossi. In terms of literary
  </p>
  <p>
   intertextuality, these descriptions are a parody of Giambattista Marino’s Adone, which contains detailed
  </p>
  <p>
   descriptions of fountains that aim to evoke a similar sense of meraviglia in the reader (Giachino 2002:
  </p>
  <p>
   188; see also Mirollo 1963: 275-6).
  </p>
  <p>
   20 Rossi perhaps had in mind two of Bernini’s fountains in particular, Neptune and Triton (1622-23) and
  </p>
  <p>
   the Fontana del Tritone (1624-43), which illustrated the verses of Ov. Met. I.313 celebrating Triton’s
  </p>
  <p>
   triumph over the waters.
  </p>
  <p>
   292
  </p>
  <p>
   outermost edge of each of the pools, because the other highly extraordinary details do
  </p>
  <p>
   not allow the eye to rest on the small and ordinary ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Twin houses, almost identical in shape, size, and decor, rise up on the
  </p>
  <p>
   uppermost plateau of the ground. No other dwellings are adorned with greater splendor
  </p>
  <p>
   of regal opulence. Painted colonnades depict the most famous seas and villas from all
  </p>
  <p>
   over the world. Covered porches attached to the houses look out everywhere over the
  </p>
  <p>
   surrounding fields and hills. Paneled ceilings here; there eye-catching rooms that grab
  </p>
  <p>
   your attention with striking statues standing out with their gold inlay; here paintings
  </p>
  <p>
   created by the hands of the most skilled artists; there beautifully upholstered couches;
  </p>
  <p>
   canopies here; fine fabrics there; finally all of the ornaments that you would generally
  </p>
  <p>
   find in the great halls of discerning kings can be found in this place. The ground
  </p>
  <p>
   between the two buildings rises up gently into the form of a theater so that, I think,
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature, excited by her admiration of such a work of art, can look upon it as if watching
  </p>
  <p>
   an artistic spectacle. You climb up through the theater by way of a double stairway—
  </p>
  <p>
   with many others flanking those besides but with all of the routes converging at a single
  </p>
  <p>
   point of egress—to a courtyard whose entrance is decorated with stone balustrades. At
  </p>
  <p>
   this point your eyes, struck by such a new and unexpected sight—and thinking that
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing more perfect existed than what they had seen up to now—begin to distrust their
  </p>
  <p>
   own judgment. Plane trees planted in the middle extend their branches out both to
  </p>
  <p>
   attract great admiration for their height, and, no less importantly, to provide hospitable
  </p>
  <p>
   shade. Here and there tree-lined walkways extending into colonnades made out of a
  </p>
  <p>
   narrow, double row of columns, offer a pleasant comfort to those seeking respite.
  </p>
  <p>
   293
  </p>
  <p>
   While we were inflamed by great eagerness to enjoy all of this, we heard the
  </p>
  <p>
   mighty sound of somebody knocking at the door. Gallonius sent someone to see who
  </p>
  <p>
   on earth was assailing the door, and the person said that a messenger was on his way
  </p>
  <p>
   from Dynast Bibulus21 to summon Gallonius for an important task. When the messenger
  </p>
  <p>
   was let in he said: “Dynast Bibulus, the most eminent guardian of Bacchus, and my
  </p>
  <p>
   master, commands you not to take his favor for granted, and to come to him at once. He
  </p>
  <p>
   says he desires to conduct some serious business with you in person.” To which
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius, clearly concerned and reckoning that there was some greater motivation
  </p>
  <p>
   behind the messenger’s haste, said: “Tell your master that I am already on my way.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at us he said: “I must not place anything above obeying his commands. He is
  </p>
  <p>
   the great Bibulus, the one who holds the highest office and commands the highest
  </p>
  <p>
   authority among us. Follow me with confidence, especially since the opportunity has
  </p>
  <p>
   presented itself for you to become acquainted with the splendor of this most beautiful
  </p>
  <p>
   city and the features and customs of its people. In order to prevent your foreign attire
  </p>
  <p>
   from attracting attention, however, or prompting everyone to come up to us and ask
  </p>
  <p>
   what the two of you want, why you have come, who you are, what country you are from,
  </p>
  <p>
   or who your people are, take off the clothes you are wearing and put on the ones I give
  </p>
  <p>
   you, which are more characteristic of this region.” “My friend, you have convinced us,” I
  </p>
  <p>
   said. “As you please, lead us wherever you want; we shall not diverge in any direction
  </p>
  <p>
   from your footsteps.” We changed our clothes and, around eleven o’clock, we entered
  </p>
  <p>
   the splendid city.
  </p>
  <p>
   21 This is possibly Cardinal Francesco Barberini. A bit further on we are presented with an image of this
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast surrounded by a menagerie of animals and expressing a desire to acquire a pair of monkeys, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Francesco Barberini was known for raising exotic animals (Trotta 1995: 90).
  </p>
  <p>
   294
  </p>
  <p>
   We arrived at the vast and elegant forum surrounded by churches, temples, and
  </p>
  <p>
   colonnades. High above the forum we could see a water clock with this epigram:
  </p>
  <p>
   When the heavy water inside the clepsydra sinks down, so too does the
  </p>
  <p>
   day come to an end, cast down from the vault of heaven. Alas, if our years
  </p>
  <p>
   pass by like that falling water, the fate of our ripe old age arrives all too
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly. If life perceives its demise when it has only just begun, will the
  </p>
  <p>
   brief time that is granted us be wasted and slip away? Virtue is the only
  </p>
  <p>
   thing that remains unchanging in the face of quickly passing years;
  </p>
  <p>
   everything else rushes past under the pressure of its own weight.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because it was the hottest time of year, many noblemen—even many who do not need
  </p>
  <p>
   to sing for their supper—were being carried about on horses and in carriages and were
  </p>
  <p>
   moving slowly about the crowded streets of the city, the copiously flowing fountains, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the broad piazzas, in order, I reckon, to find some cool relief. But it was the splendor of
  </p>
  <p>
   certain individuals that particularly caught our eye. They were being ferried about in
  </p>
  <p>
   carriages that were resplendent with much gold and purple, and they seemed to
  </p>
  <p>
   confound and throw everything into disorder wherever they went.22 Their servants
  </p>
  <p>
   moved the crowds aside, driving away any horses, mules, or carts that were getting in
  </p>
  <p>
   their way. What is more, everyone stood in respect before them as if they were gods
  </p>
  <p>
   descended from the heavens, moved out of their way, doffed their hats, sank down to
  </p>
  <p>
   their knees, and brought their horses and carriages to a halt. When Gallonius saw us
  </p>
  <p>
   admiring this sight, as if gripped by such splendor, he said: “Don’t be astonished; those
  </p>
  <p>
   are the dynasts I was telling you about. Do you see the honor that is bestowed on them
  </p>
  <p>
   as if they were gods on earth?” “Goodness,” I exclaimed. “What elegance! What luxury!
  </p>
  <p>
   22 John M. Hunt (2010: 698-9) explains that, since the late sixteenth century, carriages had become an
  </p>
  <p>
   integral part of the elite lifestyle of wealthy Romans and were seen as “a major conveyor of honor,
  </p>
  <p>
   prestige, magnificence, and a host of other noble traits”; status was further communicated by the
  </p>
  <p>
   decoration of the carriages “gilded with silver and gold, covered in silk and velvet, and his horses dressed
  </p>
  <p>
   in ribbons.”
  </p>
  <p>
   295
  </p>
  <p>
   In Rome no senator or consul is adorned with the trappings of such wealth—not even
  </p>
  <p>
   Tiberius himself, lord of all. He barely exceeds the proper measure of a citizen in his
  </p>
  <p>
   whole manner of living.”
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime we had arrived at that important man’s palace. In front of his
  </p>
  <p>
   palace we saw a courtyard and a splendid walkway. Entering rather confidently, we
  </p>
  <p>
   stepped first into the peristyle. At the far side of the peristyle was a fountain worthy of
  </p>
  <p>
   the dynast. A statue of Bacchus made of marble and sitting on a wine jug seemed to be
  </p>
  <p>
   urinating into a pool below, and on its broad base was inscribed, in large letters, this
  </p>
  <p>
   epigram:
  </p>
  <p>
   You who see this statue of Bacchus placed here, urinating into this big
  </p>
  <p>
   pool but filling it with clear water, ask that he bestow gifts worthy of the
  </p>
  <p>
   god Bacchus and that he offer foaming young wine in place of his cold
  </p>
  <p>
   stream. Then his bladder will be free, with no kidney stone to obstruct it,
  </p>
  <p>
   so that, once water has been banished, wine will always be consumed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius asked one of the servants to tell his master that he had responded to his
  </p>
  <p>
   summons and had arrived, and then to ask him if he wanted anything. The servant
  </p>
  <p>
   replied that every approach to the master was currently blocked because he was
  </p>
  <p>
   feeding dinner (that he had prepared with his own hands) to his parrots, nightingales,
  </p>
  <p>
   cats, monkeys, and dogs, which he loved more than his own eyes. Gallonius said to
  </p>
  <p>
   him: “Tell him I’m here; otherwise I won’t delay him.” In the meantime, while the servant
  </p>
  <p>
   left and came back, I saw many epitaphs affixed here and there on the walls. I asked
  </p>
  <p>
   what their significance was. Someone responded: “These are epitaphs written in honor
  </p>
  <p>
   of the deceased cats and dogs that the master loved, and for whom he celebrated last
  </p>
  <p>
   296
  </p>
  <p>
   rites while shedding many tears.”23 I began transcribing them in the notebook that I
  </p>
  <p>
   always carried with me:
  </p>
  <p>
   EPITAPH OF NICOLOSA THE CAT
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are asking, I was Nicolosa, a good cat to whom a lizard I consumed
  </p>
  <p>
   brought an undeserving death. Dying, I was ashamed to go softly while
  </p>
  <p>
   lying on a bed or pouring out my weak limbs onto the hard ground. I fought
  </p>
  <p>
   for a long time, not ceding to death without a struggle, but in vain. Alas, in
  </p>
  <p>
   the end, perfidious death was stronger than I. Thus it is granted to me to
  </p>
  <p>
   live forever always wandering about the house and the high rooftops. But
  </p>
  <p>
   you, colorful lizards with your scaly backs, I will chase you out of the
  </p>
  <p>
   sunny spots into the dank shadows.
  </p>
  <p>
   EPITAPH OF RUSPOLUS THE PUPPY
  </p>
  <p>
   Thus the invisible fates cut short the threads of your life, Ruspolus, love
  </p>
  <p>
   and delight of your master. Lesbia did not mar her bright eyes as she
  </p>
  <p>
   mourned the sad fate of her departed sparrow24 as much as your master
  </p>
  <p>
   did when he sullied his face with flowing tears as he performed your last
  </p>
  <p>
   rites. But let my mourning have an effect, for the dark Underworld has not
  </p>
  <p>
   led you away but the bright stars in the sky hold you, so that, hereafter,
  </p>
  <p>
   with the constellation of the dry dog star banished, summers will be milder
  </p>
  <p>
   under your command.
  </p>
  <p>
   I had begun copying down another epitaph to yet another cat when Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   was summoned. We came running, went up the stairs, and were led into the room
  </p>
  <p>
   where that first citizen was banqueting, lying on a bed that had ivory legs and was
  </p>
  <p>
   covered with purple and gold. He was hemmed in on all sides by a throng of cats and
  </p>
  <p>
   dogs, one of which was sitting on his shoulder, one around his neck, one was looking
  </p>
  <p>
   around for food, one was snatching a choice morsel out of his hands with its paws bent
  </p>
  <p>
   around it, one was barking, and one was lying peacefully at its master’s feet hoping for
  </p>
  <p>
   some charity. When he noticed us approaching he looked at Gallonius and said: “Do
  </p>
  <p>
   23 Girolamo Aleandro, the younger, dedicatee of Eudemia, published a volume of poems upon the death
  </p>
  <p>
   of his dog titled In obitum Aldinae catellae lacrymae poeticae (Parisiis: Apud Nicolaum Buon, 1622). I
  </p>
  <p>
   thank Mark T. Riley for bringing it to my attention, as well as for referring me to an example of a poem
  </p>
  <p>
   dedicated to a dog in Argenis II.13.6 (Barclay, Riley, and Huber 2004: 330-1).
  </p>
  <p>
   24 A reference to Lesbia’s dead sparrow in Catull. II and III. See also Eud. 1998 Lib. I n. 6.
  </p>
  <p>
   297
  </p>
  <p>
   you know why I ordered you to be brought here?” “Indeed, I do not,” replied Gallonius.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But I hurried back here in compliance with your orders, and I now await your wish.” “I
  </p>
  <p>
   will tell you what I want,” he said. “Today, while I was at leisure and being driven around
  </p>
  <p>
   the city, I caught sight of two monkeys playing in the window of a private house near the
  </p>
  <p>
   shrine of Vesta, and I remarked to myself that I had never seen more charming
  </p>
  <p>
   specimens in my life. See to it that you bring them to me as a gift, either by entreaty or,
  </p>
  <p>
   if it is not otherwise possible, for a price. Do not spare any effort or expense for I am
  </p>
  <p>
   burning with an incredible desire to possess them.” “I understand,” said Gallonius. “I will
  </p>
  <p>
   soon carry out your order and, however cunning and clever their owner may be that he
  </p>
  <p>
   cannot easily be taken in by tricks, I can nevertheless satisfy your wish; I will contrive, I
  </p>
  <p>
   will find a way, I will fabricate a ruse by which he will be nicely taken in.” “You have
  </p>
  <p>
   made me a wonderful promise,” said Bibulus. “Your good deeds exhort me, by god, to
  </p>
  <p>
   repay you with some sort of agreeable gift. But I cannot afford much and I am ashamed
  </p>
  <p>
   of giving you too little.” Gallonius replied: “That is in keeping with your benevolence.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Off you go,” Bibulus said, “and give it your all.” Gallonius responded: “Is there anything
  </p>
  <p>
   else my cunning can accomplish for you in addition to this?” “Not at this time,” replied
  </p>
  <p>
   Bibulus.
  </p>
  <p>
   And so we set off, we arrived at the front door, and there we saw a filthy, sick
  </p>
  <p>
   man being carried in someone’s arms and placed in a sedan chair. As soon as
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius saw him he said: “What’s all this, my Agrostes?25 (for that was the man’s
  </p>
  <p>
   name). Why are you so pale? Why are your limbs so infirm?” “Because—poor me!—I
  </p>
  <p>
   25 Vincenzo Gramigna (1580-1627). IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. I n. 8) does not identify the person behind
  </p>
  <p>
   this pseudonym but he does point out that the name means a “rustic man” or “hunter” (from the Greek
  </p>
  <p>
   αγρωστής). Rossi devotes a portrait to Gramigna in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   298
  </p>
  <p>
   am suffering from quotidian fever,26 and I fear the worst unless god sees to it that I
  </p>
  <p>
   recover from this illness, or that it at least doesn’t put me out of commission for many
  </p>
  <p>
   months.” “I pray to Aesculapius and Salus for it not to be so. Cheer up, your fever will
  </p>
  <p>
   soon pass, my eyebrow is twitching to that effect.27 But where did you contract such a
  </p>
  <p>
   grave illness? And where are you off to so sick? You know that this nobleman, who
  </p>
  <p>
   embraces even wild animals with such generosity, will bring you anything you need.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Agrostes responded: “The unrelenting labor of writing, staying up all night, and running
  </p>
  <p>
   back and forth in service of that man is the cause of my illness. But now, because I can
  </p>
  <p>
   be of no use to him on account of my illness, I am being taken to the hospital that is
  </p>
  <p>
   attached to the nearest Temple of Aesculapius. Alas—poor me!—what have I been
  </p>
  <p>
   reduced to?”
  </p>
  <p>
   While he was busy moaning, a young man named Fossio28 arrived just in the
  </p>
  <p>
   nick of time. Holding his cloak while sweating and gasping for breath he exclaimed:
  </p>
  <p>
   “What a shameful crime! Will this most learned man, this distinguished writer, the
  </p>
  <p>
   greatest poet endowed with the best and most upright character, die in a public hospital
  </p>
  <p>
   26 Malaria. The attribute “quotidian” refers to the periodicity of a malarial attack, meaning it peaks every
  </p>
  <p>
   twenty-four hours. The name of the disease comes from the Italian mal’aria, meaning “bad air.” Before it
  </p>
  <p>
   was discovered, in the late nineteenth century, that malaria was caused by parasites in the bloodstream
  </p>
  <p>
   from mosquito vectors, people believed in a miasmatic cause of the disease. Located on swampy terrain,
  </p>
  <p>
   Rome was known for its pestilential air, which was particularly acute in summer and fall and led to annual
  </p>
  <p>
   outbreaks of malaria during these months (Salares 2002: 1-2, 7, 11).
  </p>
  <p>
   27 This phrase from Plaut. Pseud. I.I.107 is from Plautus and Riley 1909-10.
  </p>
  <p>
   28 Marco Antonio Foppa (1603-1673) was from a wealthy family originally from Bergamo. His literary
  </p>
  <p>
   interests were mostly focused on editing works of Torquato Tasso. Vincenzo Gramigna apparently did
  </p>
  <p>
   pass away in Foppa’s home, thus being spared the indignity of dying in a hospital. This is memorialized in
  </p>
  <p>
   a 1627 letter from Rossi to Foppa: “Etenim, nisi humanitas ac liberalitas tua praesto fuisset, vir
  </p>
  <p>
   doctissimus ac sapientissimus . . . vel in aliquo nosocomio, vel in publico, vel prope dixerim sub dio,
  </p>
  <p>
   animam exhalasset” (“If it had not been for your humanity and generosity, that most learned and wise
  </p>
  <p>
   man . . . would have breathed his last in some hospital, in public, or, I dare say, outside”; Ep. ad. div.
  </p>
  <p>
   1.III.VIII).
  </p>
  <p>
   299
  </p>
  <p>
   like any old common person? Will this talent worthy of immortality, this paragon of virtue
  </p>
  <p>
   and honesty itself, be without the sort of help that even the filthiest, most degenerate
  </p>
  <p>
   men possess in spades? Are those men, those first citizens, who are obliged to you
  </p>
  <p>
   because of your long familiarity and association, treating you so disgracefully and so
  </p>
  <p>
   shamefully? While they may bring this sort of shame upon themselves, I cannot endure
  </p>
  <p>
   that this great man not enjoy my devotion, service, or duty toward him. Go, get a move
  </p>
  <p>
   on and carry him to my house. I will receive him under my roof, I will settle him in my
  </p>
  <p>
   room, and even in my own bed. I will round up the most sought after doctors in the
  </p>
  <p>
   entire city, and I will not tolerate him being without anything that might be beneficial for
  </p>
  <p>
   alleviating his illness.”29 When Fossio had finished arranging this he followed on foot,
  </p>
  <p>
   repeatedly cautioning the men carrying the sedan chair to step carefully and at an easy
  </p>
  <p>
   pace, so Agrostes’s illness wouldn’t be aggravated by a sudden jolt.
  </p>
  <p>
   We, on the other hand—because it was that time of day—hurried to Gallonius’s
  </p>
  <p>
   house, since he had shortly before obtained permission for us to lodge there. We had
  </p>
  <p>
   almost reached his house when a letter was delivered from a certain Hermagoras,30
  </p>
  <p>
   recently elected into the dynast class, which contained the following:
  </p>
  <p>
   FROM HERMAGORAS TO GALLONIUS, GREETINGS. The highest level of dignity,
  </p>
  <p>
   to which I have recently ascended, demands that I prepare my house and
  </p>
  <p>
   my household in such a distinguished and richly adorned manner, for my
  </p>
  <p>
   wife and myself, that it is worthy of me and the position I now hold.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because I am away from the city, however, I am compelled to commit this
  </p>
  <p>
   responsibility to the charge of the bearer of this letter, in whom I have the
  </p>
  <p>
   utmost trust of my affairs and to whom I believe my own reputation is dear.
  </p>
  <p>
   For this reason I am asking you, on behalf of our friendship, to take up this
  </p>
  <p>
   business and to find a spacious and grand house for me to rent, and to
  </p>
  <p>
   assemble a staff of servants that is in keeping with my rank. However, as
  </p>
  <p>
   29 Rossi’s aforementioned letter to Foppa describes this kind act of bringing Gramigna into his home, his
  </p>
  <p>
   room, and even into his own bed (“tecto recipere, in tuo cubiculo, atque adeo in tuo lectulo collocare”).
  </p>
  <p>
   30 Hermagoras (or Hermagora) was a famous Greek rhetorician from Rhodes.
  </p>
  <p>
   300
  </p>
  <p>
   to the type of people I would like, just so you know my opinion: I desire
  </p>
  <p>
   good-looking ones, elegant and well dressed. And it does not matter if
  </p>
  <p>
   they are immoral or dishonest, so long as they are suitable. And I will even
  </p>
  <p>
   release you from concerning yourself with choosing one or two of them,
  </p>
  <p>
   from among educated or learned men, who can draft my official letters or
  </p>
  <p>
   legal decisions. Whatever is on offer of that kind of person is a complete
  </p>
  <p>
   waste. Nowadays any old clerk or two-bit lawyer can handle these tasks
  </p>
  <p>
   satisfactorily. Keep this in mind especially, that I desire only my chef to be
  </p>
  <p>
   outstanding, someone who can cook to please even the dead. And I would
  </p>
  <p>
   like you to strive in this matter with every force of your diligence and
  </p>
  <p>
   industry. See to it that you are well.
  </p>
  <p>
   After reading this letter Gallonius looked at me and said: “How does his character seem
  </p>
  <p>
   to you?” “Outstanding indeed, and noble,” I responded. “And nothing but good can be
  </p>
  <p>
   hoped from it.” While we were admiring the wisdom of that great man, who considers
  </p>
  <p>
   the prestige of an entire household to be located solely in having a superior chef, a
  </p>
  <p>
   carriage almost ran me over while I had my guard down and was distracted. But
  </p>
  <p>
   someone grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out of the way removing me from
  </p>
  <p>
   danger. Once I had recovered from fright, I asked what man was so powerful that he
  </p>
  <p>
   could destroy everyone in his path with his carriage. Smiling, Gallonius replied: “You are
  </p>
  <p>
   mistaken. It is a woman, not a man, who rides around in that carriage. That is
  </p>
  <p>
   Pasicompsa,31 a dynast’s wife. She is a noblewoman famous for her style and beauty
  </p>
  <p>
   and for her sexual desire and extravagance besides, much like Sallust’s Sempronia.32
  </p>
  <p>
   From the cradle, as they say, she propositioned trusting and honorable men with lewd
  </p>
  <p>
   31 Pasicompsa (from the Greek πᾶσ-κομψή, meaning “adorned” or “well-dressed”), is the name of a
  </p>
  <p>
   prostitute (“Pasicompsa meretrix”) in Plaut. Merc. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. I n. 9.
  </p>
  <p>
   32 Sallust’s description of Sempronia, whom he lists among Catiline’s conspirators, appears at Cat. 25.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ronald Syme (1964: 134-5) suggests that the historical Sempronia was the daughter of Sempronius
  </p>
  <p>
   Tuditanus. Her historical identification, however, is less important than what she represents in Sallust’s
  </p>
  <p>
   narrative: in overstepping the bounds of female propriety by actively pursuing sexual encounters,
  </p>
  <p>
   disregarding her reputation, and spending freely, she embodies the “lubido” and “luxuria” that is
  </p>
  <p>
   supplanting “virtus” in Roman society and bringing about its disintegration. For more about Sempronia
  </p>
  <p>
   see Boyd 1987: 185-6. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. I n. 10.
  </p>
  <p>
   301
  </p>
  <p>
   and forbidden love, so that she always had someone distinguished to whom she could
  </p>
  <p>
   give herself in secret, unbeknownst to her husband. Now, however, having been
  </p>
  <p>
   widowed from her husband, she indulges herself much more. As much as age has
  </p>
  <p>
   subtracted from her beauty, to that same degree it has added to her libido. Since on
  </p>
  <p>
   account of her looks (which are not getting any better) she does not easily fall in love
  </p>
  <p>
   with those who feel the same way toward her, she holds a few sons of frugal and stingy
  </p>
  <p>
   fathers in her sway with her riches, which are ample. Even now she is staving off the
  </p>
  <p>
   destitution of someone or other’s adolescent son who lost his shirt at Janus’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Exchange.33 There are some, however, who resist and reject her, considering her gifts
  </p>
  <p>
   not to be worth all that much. As the story goes about one young man, whom she could
  </p>
  <p>
   not stop sending poorly written letters to, he finally responded thus (I happen to have
  </p>
  <p>
   one of his letters on me):
  </p>
  <p>
   CLEOBULUS34 TO PASICOMPSA, I BID YOU TEARS AND BAD WISHES. Wicked
  </p>
  <p>
   woman, why are you after me, violent and seized by frenzied passion to
  </p>
  <p>
   your very core, even though, any minute now, you are already so close to
  </p>
  <p>
   death, so close to your doleful funeral pyre. Like a savage heifer in a
  </p>
  <p>
   grassy field driven mad by desire, you vainly hasten to bend a bull to your
  </p>
  <p>
   will, whether he is open to your entreaties or unmoved by your demands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your disdain for your lovers and your charms are unbecoming to someone
  </p>
  <p>
   who is repulsive due to old age; an old woman is busy with the spindle,
  </p>
  <p>
   the duties of feminine yarn, and the well-worn kitchen. There, among the
  </p>
  <p>
   cats and dogs, she cleverly tells stories. Since you are worn out from
  </p>
  <p>
   frequent childbirth, give the sweet citharas, dancers, and tuneful lyres to
  </p>
  <p>
   tender girls and boys, and keep your bad traits to yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Pasicompsa had finished reading the letter, her anger reached such a pitch that,
  </p>
  <p>
   without a doubt, she appeared to everyone to be in a rage and to have lost her mind, to
  </p>
  <p>
   33 Janus’s Exchange (the Janus medius or Middle Janus) refers to the place in the Forum where bankers
  </p>
  <p>
   and speculators gathered for business (Platner and Ashby 1929).
  </p>
  <p>
   34 Both manuscript keys I have consulted (Appendix A) identify Cleobulus as a certain man named
  </p>
  <p>
   “Santi,” lover of the “duchessa Sforza.” Cleobulus is also a character in Barclay’s Argenis.
  </p>
  <p>
   302
  </p>
  <p>
   be threatening Cleobulus in absentia, yelling, and unable to contain her tears. But he
  </p>
  <p>
   was not moved by her tears or threats any more than if he were made of stone or
  </p>
  <p>
   wood.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When he had finished speaking, we entered Gallonius’s house, and we were
  </p>
  <p>
   welcomed graciously in all aspects, with Pasicompsa’s anger and extravagance
  </p>
  <p>
   providing an opportunity for delightful conversation. Paulus Aemilius said: “Contempt for
  </p>
  <p>
   old age fills a woman’s nose with bile. There is nothing more defiant than an immoral
  </p>
  <p>
   woman. Once she has surrendered her modesty and decency, she will never get it
  </p>
  <p>
   back, even with a team of four white horses. Wherever Ceres and Bacchus go, chastity
  </p>
  <p>
   flees as fast as it can. A woman who is on fire with sexual desire is like a sea that no
  </p>
  <p>
   rivers or streams can fill. The fever of luxury, like fire, is extinguished not by fueling
  </p>
  <p>
   desire but by taking it away. Women’s insatiability can reduce her many young lovers to
  </p>
  <p>
   exhaustion; she, however, imposes no limits on herself. If her fierce desire is raging
  </p>
  <p>
   because of someone’s station or wealth, she will not be held back by any restraints of
  </p>
  <p>
   duty, laws, or her own reputation. She believes she is allowed to do anything and that
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing is off-limits. Speeches, chidings, and warnings may as well be stones to the
  </p>
  <p>
   shameless woman, which may knock out her brains but never instill any good sense.
  </p>
  <p>
   Any man who is a slave to his sexual desire is to be pitied! Whoever finds himself in
  </p>
  <p>
   such chains should break free of those fetters, if he can. He who submits to love places
  </p>
  <p>
   himself in heavy shackles. Chastity is often consistent with an unattractive body; a
  </p>
  <p>
   debauched man is rarely good looking. The woman who confines her virtue within the
  </p>
  <p>
   walls of honor should take care that it does not fly away. Honor is like a captive bird
  </p>
  <p>
   that, when kept in an open cage, flies away never to be captured again. Chastity is a
  </p>
  <p>
   303
  </p>
  <p>
   woman’s only mark of honor; if she loses it, she cannot regain it again at any price.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anyone who desires to obtain something positive from a woman who has lost her
  </p>
  <p>
   chastity—her chief ornament—is taking the clothes off a naked man’s back.” After he
  </p>
  <p>
   had finished recounting this and similar things, Paulus Aemilius went off to bed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book Two
  </p>
  <p>
   Tossed about at sea by that endless storm and worn out from the previous day’s
  </p>
  <p>
   journey, we fell into such a deep sleep that we did not wake up until the sun had risen
  </p>
  <p>
   and filled everything with light. When we finally got up and left our room, Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   invited us into the gardens of a certain dynast who, as he told it, had risen from the
  </p>
  <p>
   deepest depths of squalor, both in life and in fortune, into a state of immense wealth. “It
  </p>
  <p>
   is my understanding,” said Gallonius, “that a sick young man, who is very dear to me, is
  </p>
  <p>
   being kept there; unless you think otherwise, I would like to go visit him. But you won’t
  </p>
  <p>
   mind going because there are no gardens in this region that you would consider more
  </p>
  <p>
   worth seeing.” We indicated our willingness to go and set off with him. While we were
  </p>
  <p>
   en route, we asked Gallonius why everyone in Eudemia is white if Mauritanians are
  </p>
  <p>
   black. He responded that, first of all, the island had been cut off for a long time from the
  </p>
  <p>
   rest of Mauritania and, second, that the women, after intermingling with the Romans,
  </p>
  <p>
   had given birth to children who looked like their fathers.
  </p>
  <p>
   After traveling a distance of two miles in conversation about this and other
  </p>
  <p>
   matters, we arrived at the gardens. We knocked at the gate, it opened, we entered.
  </p>
  <p>
   When I gazed upon that beautiful sight, it seemed as if it was not just some ordinary
  </p>
  <p>
   garden that appeared before me, but heaven itself—and even the very kingdom of Jove.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once the gates opened, the entirety of all creation presented itself on display for our
  </p>
  <p>
   viewing pleasure. The garden was so beautiful that it was not possible to imagine a
  </p>
  <p>
   304
  </p>
  <p>
   more splendid sight. The first thing you see as you enter is a flat expanse of land
  </p>
  <p>
   surrounded by many walkways decorated by splendid fountains and adorned with
  </p>
  <p>
   flowers of various kinds. This space houses a theater at the far end with stairways that
  </p>
  <p>
   are constructed and composed of genuine marble. Many streams bubble up and flow
  </p>
  <p>
   from each of the stairways and, much like a crowd of theatergoers, they appear to look
  </p>
  <p>
   toward a fountain in the middle of the theater and to applaud a play with a soothing
  </p>
  <p>
   murmur simulating favorable acclamation. Stairways made of stone ascend here and
  </p>
  <p>
   there out of the theater toward an extraordinary artistic marvel: A level and square
  </p>
  <p>
   expanse supports many trees planted in a quincunx35 formation and is surrounded by
  </p>
  <p>
   an enclosure covered in royal laurel.36 Impossibly tall plane trees have pride of place in
  </p>
  <p>
   the middle. Below their treetops stand many smaller trees on both sides, very different
  </p>
  <p>
   to the planes in height but much the same in dignity and excellence; all royal laurels are
  </p>
  <p>
   wonderfully beautiful, after all. In the middle under the very tallest plane trees stretches
  </p>
  <p>
   a marble table that extends almost sixty feet in length and fifteen feet in width. Many
  </p>
  <p>
   streams of water, flowing gently out and returning back in, divide the table lengthwise
  </p>
  <p>
   from top to bottom leaving enough space on either side for dining and offering the
  </p>
  <p>
   dinner guests welcome spring water and coolness. A fountain placed within view offers
  </p>
  <p>
   delight, astonishing in its very artistry: A figure of Triton made out of marble sits on a
  </p>
  <p>
   35 A geometric pattern consisting of five points arranged in the form of the letter X, with four of them
  </p>
  <p>
   forming a square and a fifth at its center, like the five-dot side of dice.
  </p>
  <p>
   36 Laurus regia (royal laurel) might be a sweet bay (or bay laurel), whose Latin name is laurus nobilis;
  </p>
  <p>
   since I cannot be sure of the exact identification of this plant, however, I have kept my translation close to
  </p>
  <p>
   the Latin. Pliny (HN XXXIX.129-30) writes of this plant: “[laurus] regia quae coepit Augusta appellari,
  </p>
  <p>
   amplissima et arbore et folio, bacis gustatu quoque non asperis. aliqui negant eandem esse et suum
  </p>
  <p>
   genus regiae faciunt longioribus foliis latioribusque” (“the royal laurel, which has begun to be called the
  </p>
  <p>
   Augusta laurel, [is] a very large tree with a very large leaf and berries without any rough taste. Some say
  </p>
  <p>
   that the royal laurel and the Augusta are not the same, and make out the royal to be a special kind, with
  </p>
  <p>
   longer and broader leaves”; translation from Harvard Loeb edition).
  </p>
  <p>
   305
  </p>
  <p>
   crab, as if on horseback, and looks as though he is sounding a note with a horn that is
  </p>
  <p>
   turned toward his mouth. You would swear you could hear him—such is the artist’s
  </p>
  <p>
   precision that lends credence to the fiction—were it not for the fact that five streams,
  </p>
  <p>
   flowing amply from his horn, disabuse your ears of that illusion. Next, between the
  </p>
  <p>
   crab’s claws (which are capacious enough to hold a very large stream) a large quantity
  </p>
  <p>
   of water is forced into a shell and poured back out again, through conduits that are
  </p>
  <p>
   carved into it, into a pool below. This pool, in turn, drives the water through many more
  </p>
  <p>
   channels into another much larger pool that is placed below that one. Once it fills
  </p>
  <p>
   completely with water, that pool, following the example of the one above it, carries all
  </p>
  <p>
   the excess water into a receptacle at ground level that is located in front of the
  </p>
  <p>
   onlooker’s feet. Finally, two enormous figures representing rivers pour forth veritable
  </p>
  <p>
   reservoirs of water from urns on each side of that pool complete with a final reward in
  </p>
  <p>
   the form of ferns, moss, maidenhair ferns, and other sorts of verdant plant-life, which
  </p>
  <p>
   the moisture below draws out around them. Now the most beautiful—and first and
  </p>
  <p>
   foremost delightful—place, which demands that a viewer not pass by quickly but linger
  </p>
  <p>
   and stop in contemplation, seems to beckon a guest to stop where he was about to
  </p>
  <p>
   linger and to relish the ability to walk around safe from the harmful sun. Many columns
  </p>
  <p>
   rise up on both sides of the fountain to create two colonnades, which many vine shoots
  </p>
  <p>
   cover like a roof. Many branches encircle these colonnades on all sides twisting in on
  </p>
  <p>
   each other, so that the sun’s rays can hardly penetrate through their dense shade. Your
  </p>
  <p>
   eyes would never be satiated, captivated as they are by this sight and this beauty. They
  </p>
  <p>
   would never seek out anything better or more perfect, were it not for the fact that the
  </p>
  <p>
   aforementioned double stairway behind the fountain, built in the form of a triangle,
  </p>
  <p>
   306
  </p>
  <p>
   summons those onlookers—delighted for a long time but not fulfilled—to that place
  </p>
  <p>
   where they can gaze upon the ultimate artistic undertaking.
  </p>
  <p>
   First there are railings affixed to the front of the stairways—magnificent to
  </p>
  <p>
   behold—and waters flowing out of various places adorn and embellish the fountain
  </p>
  <p>
   standing before them. The stairways lead to a place that is full of grand and wonderful
  </p>
  <p>
   objects. Here art, rivaling itself, is surpassed by itself; here Nature favors the enterprise
  </p>
  <p>
   of art, its rival, for it is Nature who supplies the streams of water with great force and
  </p>
  <p>
   abundance and employs them for exhibiting these astonishing works of art. Here
  </p>
  <p>
   groves, not sprung up by chance but planted with design, extend within a broad field;
  </p>
  <p>
   over here aviaries, supported by columns, encircle and enclose those groves. In the
  </p>
  <p>
   portico and entrance of this most splendid place a chain carved out of stone extends
  </p>
  <p>
   along a sloping surface, through which water flows toward the aforementioned crab with
  </p>
  <p>
   such artistry that the water, twisted and coiled into many circles, seems to resemble the
  </p>
  <p>
   links of a chain; in addition, the noise it emits as it flows makes it sound like chains on
  </p>
  <p>
   account of its force and rapid motion. These chains, drawn out in a long line, connect to
  </p>
  <p>
   the crab’s claws in such a way that you would think the crab was grabbing hold of them
  </p>
  <p>
   and hanging on so as not to be carried away. Giant wooden arches, adorned with tightly
  </p>
  <p>
   clinging ivy, rise up just above the chain into the likeness of a royal palace. You would
  </p>
  <p>
   point to them as an exemplar for any ambitious artist coming after. These arches are
  </p>
  <p>
   enclosed by four gabled shrines, along with a large and august temple without gables
  </p>
  <p>
   that has a fountain in the middle. These look much like burial monuments, round and
  </p>
  <p>
   wide at the bottom and narrow and pointed at the top; at the uppermost point they
  </p>
  <p>
   produce water that sprays up out of a bowl. The result is that the whole work appears to
  </p>
  <p>
   307
  </p>
  <p>
   be made for the delight of the greatest kings, not just for the pleasure of the person who
  </p>
  <p>
   commissioned it as an example for other gardens.
  </p>
  <p>
   After we had thoroughly surveyed the gardens, we entered a villa that was ample
  </p>
  <p>
   indeed and fully appointed (but was nothing compared to the gardens) where, in a
  </p>
  <p>
   lovely, bright room beneath a silk canopy, lay a young man who was more corrupted by
  </p>
  <p>
   luxury than consumed by some sort of illness. Gallonius said to him: “What is this
  </p>
  <p>
   sickness?” “A fever,” he responded. Gallonius retorted: “Didn’t you just get over a fever
  </p>
  <p>
   yesterday or the day before? Have you had anything to eat?” While he was saying this
  </p>
  <p>
   in a loud voice a young woman entered the room, her hair flying everywhere. She
  </p>
  <p>
   banged her head against the wall and cried: “Poor me, what is this? Why can’t I tackle
  </p>
  <p>
   this sickness that is weakening you so? What will become of me if you succumb to what
  </p>
  <p>
   befalls all men?”37 Clearly moved, he said: “Don’t fret about it, or that will add to my
  </p>
  <p>
   sickness too! The very sight of you robs my illness of all its power.” In order to give him
  </p>
  <p>
   some respite from his crying and wailing, the woman ordered him up a sumptuous lunch
  </p>
  <p>
   and gathered many gifts together. Admiring the woman’s kindness, we could have
  </p>
  <p>
   sworn we were witnessing a tried and true example of extraordinary love, and we asked
  </p>
  <p>
   the person who was guarding the doors of the room what the relationship was between
  </p>
  <p>
   the woman and the sick man, whether she was his sister, wife, neighbor, or relative.
  </p>
  <p>
   “She is none of those,” he said. “She is, above all, a cunning, fawning, deceitful, greedy
  </p>
  <p>
   whore named Nanna,38 who has been sleeping with him for four months. And he is so
  </p>
  <p>
   37 = death
  </p>
  <p>
   38 Rossi’s readers would have been familiar with Pietro Aretino’s character Nanna—described by
  </p>
  <p>
   Courtney Quaintance (2015: 35) as “the most famous fictional whore of the Renaissance”—who prepares
  </p>
  <p>
   her daughter Pippa for a career in prostitution. Aretino’s dialogues featuring Nanna are titled
  </p>
  <p>
   Ragionamento della Nanna e della Antonia (1534) and Dialogo nel quale la Nanna insegna a la Pippa
  </p>
  <p>
   l’arte puttanesca (1536). Additionally, tales of prostitutes after men’s money, playing lovers off of each
  </p>
  <p>
   308
  </p>
  <p>
   firmly attached to this filthy love, as if nailed to it, that none of his friends’ reprimanding
  </p>
  <p>
   or pleading can free him from it. From what I understand, unless he brings himself back
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly within the bounds of reason (from which he is quite far removed), everything he
  </p>
  <p>
   owns will disappear in short order, exiled to the whore’s house. And so you can better
  </p>
  <p>
   understand the character and ways of this whore, listen to this skillful ruse that she used
  </p>
  <p>
   to snare a merchant over the last few months.
  </p>
  <p>
   “This merchant was hopelessly in love with her, and he bound her to himself as
  </p>
  <p>
   his mistress with large sums of money, so she wouldn’t be with anyone else. But as
  </p>
  <p>
   much as the poor man was burning with love, he was burning in equal amount with icy
  </p>
  <p>
   jealousy. The shrewd whore Nanna, because she knew that the merchant had taken the
  </p>
  <p>
   bait (as all people do when they believe someone loves them), worked at nothing harder
  </p>
  <p>
   than to entrap that poor man and, most significantly, to divert his property to herself,
  </p>
  <p>
   along with his heart. She used this young man here, whom I serve, to that end. Having
  </p>
  <p>
   already been in love with her for some time, the young man began stopping by her
  </p>
  <p>
   house. Because he was handsome, dapper, and charming, the merchant feared him
  </p>
  <p>
   more than he might a snake. Nanna began to praise the young man’s beauty and to
  </p>
  <p>
   offer him a lock of her hair; he (poor merchant!) became incensed and threatened the
  </p>
  <p>
   young man with a knife, which he kept hidden under his cloak, if he took Nanna under
  </p>
  <p>
   his wing. When the whore noticed that this idle merchant (who was more like a timid
  </p>
  <p>
   little woman among men than a strong man among women) had a knife, she reckoned
  </p>
  <p>
   other and employing magical incantations are reminiscent of the dialogue of Zoppino (attributed to
  </p>
  <p>
   Aretino) where the interlocutors discuss “la vita [e la] geneologia di tutte le cortigiane di Roma” (“the life
  </p>
  <p>
   and genealogy of all of the courtesans in Rome”). The full text and a translation of this work can be found
  </p>
  <p>
   in Salkeld 2001: 68-116.
  </p>
  <p>
   309
  </p>
  <p>
   that she had hit the jackpot and said to herself: ‘I will be richer than Croesus if he pulls
  </p>
  <p>
   that knife on me.’ She then sent someone over to the young man to tell him to come to
  </p>
  <p>
   her house the following night at bedtime, and to knock on the door without hesitation.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Evening came. Per the well-devised plan, the merchant came to the whore’s
  </p>
  <p>
   house, dined, and got into an argument because he was complaining that she loved the
  </p>
  <p>
   young man more than she loved him. She denied it (but only half-heartedly) and sowed
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicion here and there. The merchant protested and became carried away with rage,
  </p>
  <p>
   when (what do you know!) the young man conveniently showed up and knocked at the
  </p>
  <p>
   door. The merchant, vexed by suspicion and fearing an ambush, threw himself out of
  </p>
  <p>
   bed, flew to the window, and shouted: ‘What sort of hateful person pounds on
  </p>
  <p>
   someone’s door at this hour of the night?’ ‘It’s me,’ replied the young man. ‘Open up at
  </p>
  <p>
   once!’ When the merchant recognized the young man, he manifested all the fury in his
  </p>
  <p>
   heart shouting: ‘Get out of here! And if you don’t hurry up, you’ll be carried away!’
  </p>
  <p>
   Intending to appear more angry than intent on inflicting harm or punishment, he rushed
  </p>
  <p>
   at Nanna with his knife drawn. As if anticipating what was going to happen, while he
  </p>
  <p>
   was at the window complaining about the pounding at the door, she had secretly gotten
  </p>
  <p>
   out of bed and had filled her right hand with red ink that she had obtained for this very
  </p>
  <p>
   purpose. The merchant came at her like a madman shouting: ‘Really, you nasty
  </p>
  <p>
   woman? You dare bring your little lover here, right in front of my eyes?’ And he struck
  </p>
  <p>
   her right thigh and arm simultaneously with the flat part of his knife. Pressing on with her
  </p>
  <p>
   tricks, Nanna immediately moved her hand toward her mouth and, at the same time,
  </p>
  <p>
   tinged it with the red ink screaming: ‘Neighbors, fellow countrymen, please help me!
  </p>
  <p>
   Come bring aid to a defenseless woman! This evil man has injured my face. What
  </p>
  <p>
   310
  </p>
  <p>
   should I do? Who should I turn to? Will I dare show my face, deformed in this way, to
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone from here on out? I won’t do it—I’ll kill myself!’ This cry rose up out of the
  </p>
  <p>
   young woman. The neighbors rushed over, broke down the door, and asked what on
  </p>
  <p>
   earth was going on. Everyone was yelling and running back and forth.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The poor merchant, who knew that no harm had come to the woman by his
  </p>
  <p>
   hand, wondered at first why she was bleeding and then, fearing for himself, sought his
  </p>
  <p>
   own safety by fleeing. Taking advantage of the night to hide himself, he ran into the
  </p>
  <p>
   palace of a certain dynast, as if into a sanctuary. Reflecting upon the matter at leisure, it
  </p>
  <p>
   was not completely clear to him how he had caused her wound. He said to himself: ‘As
  </p>
  <p>
   far as I know, I struck her on her side and on her arm, not on her face, and—what is at
  </p>
  <p>
   the heart of the matter—not with the edge of my knife but with the flat part. So how did
  </p>
  <p>
   she get that wound? Or is she faking it? But I saw it with my own eyes. I believe it; after
  </p>
  <p>
   all, one’s hand does not always go where it’s directed, even when it is intended to do
  </p>
  <p>
   harm. In that moment I was angry. Rage is blind; it removes good sense and snatches
  </p>
  <p>
   away reason. What will happen now?’ While he was caught up in these thoughts and
  </p>
  <p>
   cares, his body trembling with a desire that was vying with fear, he decided to reconcile
  </p>
  <p>
   himself with the woman using his friends as intermediaries—that is to say, to soften her
  </p>
  <p>
   up with silver and not to spare any expense. He dispatched suitable men to meet with
  </p>
  <p>
   her and gave them instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But that wicked Nanna, in order to keep up her ruse, had slathered her face with
  </p>
  <p>
   ointments and swathed it with bandages. The men approached her, slowly at first; they
  </p>
  <p>
   reminded her of the changeability of circumstances, and they praised warring parties
  </p>
  <p>
   who disband when the opportunity to do so presents itself. The woman did not tolerate
  </p>
  <p>
   311
  </p>
  <p>
   their continuing on or pursuing the matter further but exclaimed suddenly: ‘Go on, get
  </p>
  <p>
   out of here—don’t discuss these matters with me! He will be summoned before all of the
  </p>
  <p>
   magistrates, I’ll make sure of it. I’ll soon destroy him, if I survive, because he caused me
  </p>
  <p>
   to be forever disgraced by this mark he put on my face. I should pardon him? Oh
  </p>
  <p>
   please—I’d rather die!’ ‘Don’t be so angry,’ they replied. ‘This is how things are when
  </p>
  <p>
   chance more than reason is in control.’ ‘Then the judge will decide,’ declared the
  </p>
  <p>
   woman. ‘I believe I have clearly made my case to him.’ When the men realized that that
  </p>
  <p>
   particular line of reasoning had been closed off, they embarked on another. ‘Look,’ they
  </p>
  <p>
   said, ‘the merchant is generous and averse to conflict. What do you want in exchange
  </p>
  <p>
   for dropping this entire lawsuit and claim?’ At first she denied that the matter could be
  </p>
  <p>
   settled with money, then (so the men would up the ante) she raged and made
  </p>
  <p>
   exaggerated demands. To make a long story short, they got her to agree, with difficulty,
  </p>
  <p>
   to be satisfied with fifty minae39 to be paid out immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But Nanna was not satisfied even with that offer. She wanted to ruin the
  </p>
  <p>
   merchant even more, so she sent someone to him, who claimed it was within his power
  </p>
  <p>
   to remove the disgraceful blemish caused by her disfigured face which the merchant
  </p>
  <p>
   had inflicted upon her. The person explained that there was a certain doctor from
  </p>
  <p>
   Campania who, with his remedies, was able to remove any trace of the wound; but the
  </p>
  <p>
   merchant needed to pay him with silver, up front, in the amount of five minae. If the
  </p>
  <p>
   merchant agreed to this, she would be inclined toward him with love and gratitude. The
  </p>
  <p>
   doctor was a quack, a very practiced swindler, especially in the worthless art of selling
  </p>
  <p>
   39 The mina was a Greek currency. A silver mina is worth 100 Attic drachmae or Roman denarii (L&amp;S).
  </p>
  <p>
   This currency often appears in Plautus’s plays.
  </p>
  <p>
   312
  </p>
  <p>
   snake oil. The poor merchant, who couldn’t bear his longing for Nanna and didn’t need
  </p>
  <p>
   to be asked twice, handed over the money without delay, which the braggart
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately shared with the woman. The merchant was present when Nanna was
  </p>
  <p>
   healed, and this is how the cunning doctor deceived him: He had pressed strings, taken
  </p>
  <p>
   from a lyre, on the spot where the whore was feigning her wound. Pressed against her
  </p>
  <p>
   in just in the right place they looked much like the groove of a scar. In the presence of
  </p>
  <p>
   the merchant, he smeared the groove with ointment and wrapped it carefully. He
  </p>
  <p>
   secretly bandaged her up with the lyre strings in such a way, a little looser each day,
  </p>
  <p>
   that it made the scar seem to disappear little by little. What should I say? Hardly eight
  </p>
  <p>
   days had gone by before it had all completely disappeared. People had already been
  </p>
  <p>
   talking about the conspicuous wound Nanna had received to her face when the news
  </p>
  <p>
   got out about this mysterious doctor’s wondrous cure. He received such a stampede of
  </p>
  <p>
   people bearing scars that he could not keep them at bay. The swindler did not waste
  </p>
  <p>
   any time rushing to flee. Since he had already collected money from everyone as a
  </p>
  <p>
   deposit, he stuffed himself with his takings and, on a certain day before daybreak and
  </p>
  <p>
   without even giving the order to pack, he pulled up stakes.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When the chamber servant had finished, he began to relate another of the
  </p>
  <p>
   whore’s deceptions, but Gallonius interrupted him as he started speaking. As he was
  </p>
  <p>
   walking away from the young man, Gallonius said to us: “You there, I need to hurry over
  </p>
  <p>
   to Plusius’s palace40 where I have contracted out my services. The hour has almost
  </p>
  <p>
   gone when I need to be there to carry out the tasks he hired me to do. His barber invited
  </p>
  <p>
   40 Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto’s urban residence was the Palazzo della Cancelleria located
  </p>
  <p>
   in the Parione neighborhood of Rome between the Campo de’ Fiori and the present Corso Vittorio
  </p>
  <p>
   Emanuele II. Cardinal Peretti Montalto was famous for his lavish lifestyle (DBI).
  </p>
  <p>
   313
  </p>
  <p>
   me to lunch later and asked me to summon anyone else who was suitable, saying that
  </p>
  <p>
   there would be room for two hangers-on. And so I will take the two of you along. You
  </p>
  <p>
   will enjoy becoming acquainted with the fine customs of these urbane people, especially
  </p>
  <p>
   in throwing parties.” “We are all yours,” I said. “Lead us wherever you want.” In short,
  </p>
  <p>
   we arrived at the palace of that great man. Gallonius went to find out what in the world
  </p>
  <p>
   his master was up to and whether he was already awake and out of bed. Someone
  </p>
  <p>
   replied: “Plusius got up a long time ago. He jumped out of bed as soon as it was light
  </p>
  <p>
   out, called for his barber, and spent two hours with him. But he so wore his poor barber
  </p>
  <p>
   out with shaving him, bathing him, and putting makeup on his face, that he drove him to
  </p>
  <p>
   exhaustion, or rather to destruction. After dismissing the barber, Plusius shut himself up
  </p>
  <p>
   in a more private room with a tailor where he grabbed a drawing-compass in his hands
  </p>
  <p>
   and tested, as was his habit, whether each of his buttons, which were sewn onto his
  </p>
  <p>
   clothing with a needle, was equidistant from the others and whether his corselet or
  </p>
  <p>
   waistcoat was fitting elegantly to his body. Two more hours were consumed in this
  </p>
  <p>
   project. Then he employed a shoemaker, tormented him, and complained that the
  </p>
  <p>
   leather his shoes were made out of was not soft enough, did not have any give, and
  </p>
  <p>
   was tough and unforgiving. Besides that, he complained that the shoes themselves
  </p>
  <p>
   were not suitable and didn’t look right on his feet. He got angry, yelled, and complained
  </p>
  <p>
   that he had been born unlucky and that nothing good ever happened to him. But soon, I
  </p>
  <p>
   hope, even the shoemaker will free his neck from those fetters, because Plusius has
  </p>
  <p>
   ordered the priests be summoned and the incense and unmixed wine be prepared, in
  </p>
  <p>
   order to make a sacrifice to Jupiter Optimus Maximus. When that is concluded, we
  </p>
  <p>
   believe, lunch will commence.”
  </p>
  <p>
   314
  </p>
  <p>
   “It’s not a bad idea” said Gallonius, “for me to head to the foyer to await Plusius’s
  </p>
  <p>
   instructions.” Gallonius led us in, and we each staked out a corner, crooked our necks,
  </p>
  <p>
   and took in everything that was being said and everything that was going on. The first
  </p>
  <p>
   question that arose among the dinner guests was which cooking method was most
  </p>
  <p>
   suitable for chicken in the summer and in the winter. And the dispute was not minimal
  </p>
  <p>
   because each person had a different preference. The man who was egging these
  </p>
  <p>
   discussions on (while everyone else contradicted him) preferred fig-pecker birds to
  </p>
  <p>
   thrush and quail to pheasant. And everyone eagerly ridiculed a certain member of the
  </p>
  <p>
   group, who seemed to possess no sense in these matters, calling him lowborn and
  </p>
  <p>
   unrefined. Worse, they said that he wasn’t even worthy of being considered a human
  </p>
  <p>
   being. From this topic they devolved into slander, and they railed against the character
  </p>
  <p>
   of women, accusing some of not preserving their modesty honorably, others of
  </p>
  <p>
   prostituting and selling their bodies—with the full knowledge of their husbands—and still
  </p>
  <p>
   others of selling their beautiful daughters’ bodies to various men for not insignificant
  </p>
  <p>
   sums of money. They told many stories besides, identifying each of these women by
  </p>
  <p>
   name. Since I had never heard of them, however, I immediately forgot them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fashion sense of these men was very elegant and stylish, albeit not very
  </p>
  <p>
   manly, and there was hardly anyone present at the banquet who could not surpass a
  </p>
  <p>
   new bride in terms of elegance and finery. It was truly ridiculous that, when two of them
  </p>
  <p>
   started fighting with each other over a woman, one of them (in order to insult him, of
  </p>
  <p>
   course) called the other a stinking goat, foul, perfidious, and obscene. The other one, in
  </p>
  <p>
   order to avenge himself at having been provoked, heaped novel insults upon the first
  </p>
  <p>
   man. Though he tried his best, he was not able to find a fiercer insult than berating him
  </p>
  <p>
   315
  </p>
  <p>
   for going around in an uncouth state, unadorned, and with a bad haircut. After we had
  </p>
  <p>
   eagerly watched this exchange we learned later that nothing was considered a greater
  </p>
  <p>
   disgrace among these people than not to lace one’s stockings with silk laces that
  </p>
  <p>
   stretched all the way down to the ground, or to permit even the smallest wrinkle in one’s
  </p>
  <p>
   collar; that no sin was considered greater than to endure one hair of one’s head or
  </p>
  <p>
   beard growing longer than the others, and then not to trim with a razor whatever had the
  </p>
  <p>
   gall to grow longer; that nothing was thought baser than to wear the same outfit for an
  </p>
  <p>
   entire meal.
  </p>
  <p>
   But Plusius’s unexpected arrival calmed any anger in these men and put them at
  </p>
  <p>
   ease. The one who drew back the curtain said cheerfully: “Pencils down, everyone—our
  </p>
  <p>
   teacher is here!” Crossing the anteroom while everyone walked ahead of him, he
  </p>
  <p>
   approached the altar of Jove, assisted the person who was conducting the sacrifice,
  </p>
  <p>
   came back, and demanded his luncheon, which Gallonius had made sure was furnished
  </p>
  <p>
   with all the trimmings. After Plusius had eaten his fill, Gallonius came over to us and
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “The man who invited me to lunch has ordered dining couches be set up in the
  </p>
  <p>
   gardens near the city next to an abundantly flowing fountain. By Hercules, you will
  </p>
  <p>
   surely take pleasure in the sight of that place. It is very beautiful on account of the
  </p>
  <p>
   greenery of the trees, and very cool thanks to the abundance of flowing waters.”
  </p>
  <p>
   To be brief, he took us there, and upon entering we were met with more water
  </p>
  <p>
   than we could recall ever having seen. Indeed, the entire place was overflowing not with
  </p>
  <p>
   fountains but with rain showers, not with streams but with rivers. Nature or engineering
  </p>
  <p>
   (it is uncertain which) had carved six caves, pleasantly and delightfully wild and faced
  </p>
  <p>
   with rough and rugged tufa, into the cliff on the hill, and this had been done in such a
  </p>
  <p>
   316
  </p>
  <p>
   way that the second set of three caves sat above the first. From these tufa rocks—
  </p>
  <p>
   which clung both inside and outside of the caves and were covered with plants of
  </p>
  <p>
   varying shades of green—powerful showers of water poured forth, filling the caves and
  </p>
  <p>
   creating a wide lake in front of them. Walls, which were rough and covered with rocks to
  </p>
  <p>
   match the wild ruggedness of the caves, rose up on either side of the hill to define the
  </p>
  <p>
   limits of the site. Raging waters flowed continuously through the walls and behind them,
  </p>
  <p>
   within the wide groves, were located marvelous tree-lined walkways. There we heard
  </p>
  <p>
   the sound of many streams falling from a great height and we beheld this spectacle that
  </p>
  <p>
   was created by fountains, groves, art, and, finally, by Nature herself. Next to that
  </p>
  <p>
   beautiful fountain, so marvelous and so cool, we came upon dining couches that had
  </p>
  <p>
   been set up and a laid table piled high with the kind of variety of sumptuous dishes that
  </p>
  <p>
   is generally furnished by those wishing to entertain their friends in a splendid manner.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, suddenly, a great noise and din reached our ears. Our lunch hosts
  </p>
  <p>
   informed us that the other invited guests had arrived. We were nine in number, but from
  </p>
  <p>
   the ruckus you would have sworn there were a hundred of us invading that place. As
  </p>
  <p>
   soon as the guests appeared they laid waste to everything (as invading forces do once
  </p>
  <p>
   a city has been captured) devouring, stuffing themselves, draining jugs of wine, and
  </p>
  <p>
   throwing everything into confusion with their battle cry. The man who had invited
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone was nearing the point of anger, shouting that everyone needed to wash their
  </p>
  <p>
   hands and take their places at the dining couches; and he succeeded, with great
  </p>
  <p>
   difficulty, in getting them to agree to sit down. There were three couches, and we
  </p>
  <p>
   reclined four to a couch. Gallonius was seated at the highest couch with me next to him,
  </p>
  <p>
   317
  </p>
  <p>
   Paulus Aemilius was seated at the middle couch, and everyone else at the low couch.41
  </p>
  <p>
   While at the table we consumed as much wine as is collected during an entire vintage
  </p>
  <p>
   season. If it were possible to count the stars in the sky, that is the number of cups of
  </p>
  <p>
   wine that were brought to the table and drained. There were five men serving us who
  </p>
  <p>
   were worn out from filling and fetching wine glasses. The banqueters let rip burps and
  </p>
  <p>
   farts to accompany their great cries and effusive laughter. The only words we heard
  </p>
  <p>
   were: “Cheers to me, cheers to you, cheers to our Plusius!” They appeared to be
  </p>
  <p>
   pouring wine not into their stomachs but into drains, or into an abyss. Some delicious
  </p>
  <p>
   dish would barely have been placed on the table before you would see it get snatched
  </p>
  <p>
   up. There was an extremely refined man in our midst who was garlanding his cup with
  </p>
  <p>
   bits of what he had been eating, as if they were roses, and whenever he filled it with
  </p>
  <p>
   wine he would guzzle the whole lot down. We were loud, we laughed raucously, and we
  </p>
  <p>
   applauded the glorious event with exclamations of approval. The feast went on almost
  </p>
  <p>
   into the evening with no moderation or diminution of drinking. Then one of Plusius’s
  </p>
  <p>
   servants arrived and announced to Gallonius that he should leave everyone and go
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly over to the magistrate, and that he should explain to him, in Plusius’s words, that
  </p>
  <p>
   the magistrate, on account of his high status, should release Toxillus42 and return him
  </p>
  <p>
   unharmed. Toxillus had been found guilty and had been thrown in jail for plundering an
  </p>
  <p>
   inheritance bequeathed to Venus, bearing false witness, and committing various other
  </p>
  <p>
   nefarious acts contrary to what was lawful and right. We were thus drawn away from the
  </p>
  <p>
   41 A Roman dining room (triclinium) consisted of group of three couches where guests would sit according
  </p>
  <p>
   to their status. The host (or host family) reclined on the lowest couch (imus lectus), especially honored
  </p>
  <p>
   guests reclined on the middle couch (medius lectus), and the high couch (summus lectus) was for low-
  </p>
  <p>
   status guests.
  </p>
  <p>
   42 Toxilus is the name of a slave in Plaut. Pers.
  </p>
  <p>
   318
  </p>
  <p>
   other revelers and we made our way to the tribunal of the magistrate, who was busy
  </p>
  <p>
   with a certain important judicial investigation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The magistrate’s attendants had dragged a young woman into court—not a bad
  </p>
  <p>
   looking one—who they were saying was a prostitute. They were complaining that she
  </p>
  <p>
   had caused them to be soundly beaten with cudgels and, so that we would believe
  </p>
  <p>
   them, they showed us their arms and backs, which were black and blue with blows. The
  </p>
  <p>
   magistrate asked who was so bold in his audacity as to trouble public officials with such
  </p>
  <p>
   a remarkable wrongdoing on account of a single whore. One man responded, who was
  </p>
  <p>
   perhaps better able to speak than the rest: “We were in the process of dragging a thief
  </p>
  <p>
   off to jail, whom we had caught red-handed. When we were passing the place where
  </p>
  <p>
   this witch lives, he freed himself from his chains, escaped our grasp, and ran into one of
  </p>
  <p>
   the houses on her street. We chased after him and, because we couldn’t see where he
  </p>
  <p>
   had gone, we searched every single house in that neighborhood. In brief, we arrived at
  </p>
  <p>
   the whore’s house and knocked on the door. When nobody answered, we assailed the
  </p>
  <p>
   door with our feet so hard that it broke. Still nothing. So we went upstairs and found the
  </p>
  <p>
   woman lying on her bed. Then I said: ‘Why aren’t you saying anything? Why did you let
  </p>
  <p>
   us break down your door? Was it so important to keep it closed?’ She remained silent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I said: ‘Look how your mind holds firm, bent on not speaking. You villain. I will
  </p>
  <p>
   drag words out of you, whether you like it or not.’ Enraged, I attacked her violently with a
  </p>
  <p>
   switch. Compelled by the pain, she finally cried ‘Hey!’ And then an incredible thing
  </p>
  <p>
   happened. Barely had she yelled ‘Hey,’ when you could feel blows of a cudgel attacking
  </p>
  <p>
   us on our shoulders, heads, and arms, like a rain- or hailstorm—but there were no
  </p>
  <p>
   319
  </p>
  <p>
   cudgels in sight, and there was nobody hitting us! Petrified with fear and badly beaten,
  </p>
  <p>
   we turned tail and ran quickly down the stairs seeking safety on foot.’”
  </p>
  <p>
   The magistrate asked the men how they thought this had happened. They
  </p>
  <p>
   answered him confidently that they thought they had experienced this because of
  </p>
  <p>
   women’s magic and incantations. They said: “You can learn what happened from this
  </p>
  <p>
   woman here, whom we brought before you as a witness to this matter.” She, as we
  </p>
  <p>
   inferred from her appearance, was a two-bit whore, a dish for the whole village. Looking
  </p>
  <p>
   at the magistrate she said: “If you can guarantee my protection, I will reveal the entire
  </p>
  <p>
   matter as it is.” The woman, having been called upon by the magistrate, explained what
  </p>
  <p>
   she knew: “Whenever our lovers leave us,” she began, “we prostitutes toss a piece of
  </p>
  <p>
   bread and cheese out the window, and we cast a spell of certain curses on it in order to
  </p>
  <p>
   summon them back. But if a black dog approaches the piece of bread to eat it, we
  </p>
  <p>
   consider it to be a good and auspicious omen that the man we desire will soon appear.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, though, until he comes (unless she is asking for trouble), the prostitute
  </p>
  <p>
   must not utter a single word. If she dares to speak she will bring misfortune upon
  </p>
  <p>
   herself. This good woman came to my house the day before, complaining because her
  </p>
  <p>
   lover was deeply angry with her. She had taken another lover without his knowledge,
  </p>
  <p>
   and, because of this, she had transferred her love and gifts to another man. She
  </p>
  <p>
   begged and pleaded for my help and for me to show her how she could get him back.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taking pity on her, so she wouldn’t return to the state from which she had risen
  </p>
  <p>
   (doubtless on the verge of poverty), I offered her some bread and cheese that I had put
  </p>
  <p>
   a spell on, and I told her to throw it down into the street. She took it, threw it down, and
  </p>
  <p>
   a dog came and ate it. Then she closes the door, gets into bed, and waits for her lover
  </p>
  <p>
   320
  </p>
  <p>
   to come, since now the only thing left to happen was for him to arrive. Indeed, he would
  </p>
  <p>
   have certainly come to her as she desired, if Fortune, who throws everything into
  </p>
  <p>
   confusion, had not prohibited it.”
  </p>
  <p>
   After the whore had recounted these things, she fell silent. Then the magistrate
  </p>
  <p>
   ordered the other woman (who had been tied up) to speak. She brazenly responded
  </p>
  <p>
   that she had never seen firewood given away so freely as it had been to her and the
  </p>
  <p>
   lictors.43 The praetor asked who did this. She responded that she believed the deed had
  </p>
  <p>
   been carried out by the spirits of the dead. To which the praetor said: “So you are a
  </p>
  <p>
   witch.” The woman, crafty and trained to malice, replied: “Not at all, except that I am too
  </p>
  <p>
   much the victim of the magic of other women. It is coming up on a year that I have been
  </p>
  <p>
   harassed by ghosts on account of a certain witch’s jealously. It often happens that, after
  </p>
  <p>
   being tormented with beatings meant to kill me, I am carried out of the house like a
  </p>
  <p>
   corpse at the hands of my neighbors.” When he heard this, the magistrate ordered that
  </p>
  <p>
   the neighbors be called as witnesses to the case. They came straight away, but
  </p>
  <p>
   because of her ties to the neighborhood, and in order to curry the woman’s favor and to
  </p>
  <p>
   save her from the peril of a conviction, the neighbors, after they had been sworn in,
  </p>
  <p>
   gave the same testimony the prostitute had given in her own defense. The magistrate
  </p>
  <p>
   was turned from severity to mercy, he absolved the woman (who was mad or crazed),
  </p>
  <p>
   and, with the approval of his legal counsel, he suspended her hearing and ordered the
  </p>
  <p>
   lictors to go hang. After the council was dismissed, the praetor withdrew from the
  </p>
  <p>
   courtroom where he had been attending to the trial, and took himself off to his house.
  </p>
  <p>
   43 That is, beaten (with a wooden cudgel) so soundly. For the source of this phrase see Chapter 2, n. 103.
  </p>
  <p>
   321
  </p>
  <p>
   In Eudemia, criminal proceedings are not carried out in the Forum, as is the
  </p>
  <p>
   practice in Rome, but they take place in the magistrates’ homes. Gallonius demanded to
  </p>
  <p>
   be taken to the magistrate, because he had something that he needed to tell him, on
  </p>
  <p>
   Plusius’s orders. The chamber servants brought him to the magistrate, who, as soon as
  </p>
  <p>
   he heard that an emissary from Plusius had arrived, immediately ordered him to be
  </p>
  <p>
   admitted. He asked for chairs and invited Gallonius to sit down, which Gallonius, of
  </p>
  <p>
   course, declined on account of his modesty. The magistrate insisted saying that he
  </p>
  <p>
   would otherwise not listen to what Gallonius had to say. Gallonius acquiesced, settled
  </p>
  <p>
   into a chair, and relayed his orders from Plusius, of which the most important was this:
  </p>
  <p>
   that the defendant Toxillus, whom the magistrate was holding in prison, had been
  </p>
  <p>
   accused of fraudulently plundering the inheritance of another; that the magistrate should
  </p>
  <p>
   be sure to absolve him with his judicial decision; and that, because of this favor, he
  </p>
  <p>
   would enter Plusius’s good graces. The magistrate responded that the prisoner was the
  </p>
  <p>
   chief of villains, that he had committed a manifest, capital, and heinous crime, and he
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “If there is a place for justice and laws, he ought to have been dragged off to his
  </p>
  <p>
   punishment a long time ago and onto a cross. Since he is so important to Plusius,
  </p>
  <p>
   however, I will find a justification for him to escape judgment unharmed. This matter
  </p>
  <p>
   regards Venus’s property and, if some of it is taken, it is to be removed without penalty.
  </p>
  <p>
   The gods are good and generous; even if they suffer an injury, they do not know how to
  </p>
  <p>
   get angry at anyone.” In brief, the magistrate promised his aid even more earnestly than
  </p>
  <p>
   was demanded of him. In order to move his thoughts from the sadness of this
  </p>
  <p>
   conversation to cheerfulness, he began to ask how Plusius was doing, what sorts of
  </p>
  <p>
   pleasures he spent his afternoons engaged in, how many glasses of wine he drank,
  </p>
  <p>
   322
  </p>
  <p>
   how capacious the tankard he drank out of was, and many other questions of this sort,
  </p>
  <p>
   to which Gallonius responded very satisfactorily.
  </p>
  <p>
   When evening fell, Gallonius got up to leave. The magistrate, out of a sense of
  </p>
  <p>
   duty, accompanied Gallonius as far as the stairs reminding him repeatedly to pass
  </p>
  <p>
   along his greetings to Plusius. At last, Gallonius, after being respectfully received and
  </p>
  <p>
   dismissed, happily hit the road with us back home. He came to the front door of a
  </p>
  <p>
   certain old friend, and, after exchanging salutations, he inquired how he was doing. The
  </p>
  <p>
   friend replied: “There is a quarrel between the magistrate and the wealthy Asterius.44 I
  </p>
  <p>
   am off to work things out between them.” “What is this I hear?” said Gallonius. “Asterius
  </p>
  <p>
   is capable of getting angry? I always thought of him as being as calm as a sea that has
  </p>
  <p>
   been allayed for the hatching of kingfisher chicks.”45 “To be sure, Asterius has returned
  </p>
  <p>
   to his old self,” the friend replied. “Now the magistrate is the only one who is angry and
  </p>
  <p>
   all worked up. Listen to this ridiculous story. Asterius had a disagreement with Robustus
  </p>
  <p>
   Ursaceus46 before the centumvirs47 regarding a financial matter, and he bound him over
  </p>
  <p>
   by bail to appear in court. The terms of the bail stipulated that Ursaceus present himself
  </p>
  <p>
   44 There are various suggestions for who is behind this astral pseudonym. Giachino (2002: 201) proposes
  </p>
  <p>
   Francesco Stelluti (1577-1652) an Italian scientist and founding member of the Accademia dei Lincei.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both manuscript keys (referred to in Appendix A) propose Giovanni Battista de Asti (1566-1620) a Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   Catholic prelate who served as Titular Bishop of Thagaste. Portraits in Rossi’s Pinacotheca suggest two
  </p>
  <p>
   other possibilities: the poet Giulio Cesare Stella (1564-1624) or, more likely, Giovanni Battista Stella (d.
  </p>
  <p>
   1621), who was an accomplished Latin writer both in poetry and prose, and who enjoyed a successful
  </p>
  <p>
   legal and ecclesiastical career achieving the position of Referendary within the papal court and eventually
  </p>
  <p>
   becoming the bishop of Bitonto in Apulia.
  </p>
  <p>
   45 The kingfisher, or halcyon, was said to hatch its eggs in a period during the winter when the seas were
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly calm, a tranquil period known as the “halcyon days.”
  </p>
  <p>
   46 Possibly Fulvio Orsini (1529-1600) an Italian humanist, historian, and archaeologist, or Alessandro
  </p>
  <p>
   Orsini (1592-1626) an Italian cardinal and patron of Galileo Galilei. Rossi devotes portraits to both in his
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinacotheca, the latter in Pinacotheca altera.
  </p>
  <p>
   47 A college of judges chosen annually to hear civil suits, in particular matters of inheritance.
  </p>
  <p>
   323
  </p>
  <p>
   in court on a certain day to hear the judges’ ruling. Ursaceus disregarded his court date,
  </p>
  <p>
   and, because of this, the so-called scofflaw was convicted, and the judicial opinion was
  </p>
  <p>
   ruled in Asterius’s favor. Ursaceus appealed the ruling to the magistrate, who
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately declared that the judges had ruled incorrectly because Ursaceus had
  </p>
  <p>
   promised, per the terms of his bail, only to present himself in court that day but not to
  </p>
  <p>
   hear the judges’ ruling; and that for him to hear the judges’ ruling, he would have to be
  </p>
  <p>
   compelled by a new order to appear. Asterius protested and explained that the force of
  </p>
  <p>
   the order was achieved by its wording, which stated that Ursaceus present himself in
  </p>
  <p>
   court to hear the ruling of the judges. The good magistrate declared that he would find
  </p>
  <p>
   no wrongdoing because, in the written order, the words ‘hear the judges’ ruling’ were
  </p>
  <p>
   not connected to the words ‘present himself,’ but were separated by punctuation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, since the words ‘hear the judges’ ruling,’ taken individually, constituted a new
  </p>
  <p>
   sentence, they indeed required a new order to appear. Shaken by such a blatant
  </p>
  <p>
   wrongdoing, Asterius set his sights on revenge and, after a few days, he wrote a letter
  </p>
  <p>
   to the magistrate with these words: ‘I entreat you, praetor sir, to come to my house
  </p>
  <p>
   tomorrow; dine with me.’ The next day the praetor arrived at the appointed time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Asterius said to him: ‘I thank you for coming, but dinner is not until tomorrow.’ ‘What’s
  </p>
  <p>
   this?’ said the magistrate, ‘You did not invite me today?’ ‘No,’ replied Asterius. ‘But I can
  </p>
  <p>
   show you your letter in which you invited me to dinner today.’ ‘Let me see the letter,’
  </p>
  <p>
   said Asterius, and he read the letter he was holding in his hand. ‘There is no error on
  </p>
  <p>
   my part, since I wrote the letter thus: I put a punctuation mark after the words ‘I entreat
  </p>
  <p>
   you to come to my house tomorrow’; because the other word ‘dine’ is the beginning of a
  </p>
  <p>
   new sentence, it indicates a different day. So you have to wait for a separate invitation.’
  </p>
  <p>
   324
  </p>
  <p>
   Angered, the magistrate said ‘Will you make fun of a magistrate in this way? You will
  </p>
  <p>
   hardly get away with this without being punished.’ ‘I have caused you no injury, this is
  </p>
  <p>
   entirely your doing. This is an example of a ruling you yourself made where you
  </p>
  <p>
   determined that it should be punctuated this way. But every law proclaims that the same
  </p>
  <p>
   rule that anyone maintains against another should also be applied to himself.’ The
  </p>
  <p>
   praetor, having been played in this way (which really steamed him), returned home
  </p>
  <p>
   without any dinner.”
  </p>
  <p>
   We laughed at the magistrate’s dull acumen. Then I said: “Is there such a
  </p>
  <p>
   shortage of prudent men in Eudemia that you need to entrust these sorts of duties to
  </p>
  <p>
   dullards like him?” Gallonius replied: “It is not surprising, since in this Republic it is not
  </p>
  <p>
   virtue or good deeds that win magistracies and honors, but chance and favors. Thus,
  </p>
  <p>
   since the learned and illustrious are overlooked, governing power is allotted to ignorant
  </p>
  <p>
   and insignificant men.” When we were done we set off, Gallonius to reconcile Asterius
  </p>
  <p>
   and the magistrate and we to alleviate the sound of our growling stomachs with food
  </p>
  <p>
   and drink.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book Three
  </p>
  <p>
   The sun had already risen joyfully from the ocean and brightened the land by
  </p>
  <p>
   diffusing its light across the entire sky, when Gallonius received the news that two
  </p>
  <p>
   young men were at the door urgently calling for him. We accompanied him as he went
  </p>
  <p>
   outside. When he asked what they wanted they replied: “You must hurry to your good
  </p>
  <p>
   friend Democritus’s house and make sure, either by comforting him, advising him, or by
  </p>
  <p>
   taking some sort of action, to free him from the illness that has vehemently taken hold of
  </p>
  <p>
   him. He didn’t eat anything yesterday evening, and he didn’t get a moment’s rest last
  </p>
  <p>
   night. When asked what the matter was he didn’t dare say; he just sighed and wept.
  </p>
  <p>
   325
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps, in the name of your mutual friendship, you can get him to tell you why he is so
  </p>
  <p>
   sick.” To which Gallonius replied: “Tell Democritus we will be there soon.” But Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   thought it best to call a doctor and bring him over to the sick man’s house. So we
  </p>
  <p>
   arrived at the home of a certain Aristarchus,48 who (as Gallonius informed us) was
  </p>
  <p>
   renowned among doctors, and we caught him contemplating his appearance in the
  </p>
  <p>
   mirror. As soon as he saw Gallonius he said: “How does my face look to you?” “Most
  </p>
  <p>
   pleasing and handsome indeed,” replied Gallonius. “And what about my physique? See
  </p>
  <p>
   how firm, nimble, and full of energy it is? Is there any woman worthy of this body?”
  </p>
  <p>
   “None,” replied Gallonius. “But put that aside for the moment and listen to why we are
  </p>
  <p>
   here. We have come to take you to a sick man, who has almost been undone by an
  </p>
  <p>
   illness of his mind, so you can heal him.” “That would be easy enough,” replied
  </p>
  <p>
   Aristarchus, “but I don’t have time right now, since I promised my services to the head
  </p>
  <p>
   flamen49 of Father Liber who has been suffering from stomach problems.” “If that is the
  </p>
  <p>
   situation,” responded Gallonius, “I would be causing harm to the welfare of the Republic
  </p>
  <p>
   if I disturbed you. Goodbye.”
  </p>
  <p>
   After we took our leave, we asked Gallonius whether or not it was reasonable for
  </p>
  <p>
   someone, in order to cure a sick person, to go to the trouble of summoning a doctor
  </p>
  <p>
   whose own mind could hardly be cured by three Antikyras.50 Gallonius smiled and said:
  </p>
  <p>
   “The state of stupidity in which that man dwells is indeed amusing and absurd. Though
  </p>
  <p>
   48 Pompeio Caimo (1568-1631) was an Italian doctor who, starting in 1602, served as the personal
  </p>
  <p>
   physician of Rossi’s patron Cardinal Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto. Rossi devotes a portrait
  </p>
  <p>
   to Caimo in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   49 Flamen: a priest of one particular diety.
  </p>
  <p>
   50 Antikyra: a town on the coast of Phocis (a region of ancient Greece) famous for hellebore, a plant that
  </p>
  <p>
   was supposed to cure madness.
  </p>
  <p>
   326
  </p>
  <p>
   he is so irregular and so ugly in appearance—as you saw—that he is more monster
  </p>
  <p>
   than man, he nevertheless boasts that he is more handsome than Adonis and Paris,
  </p>
  <p>
   and he says that women everywhere willingly pursue him. Forgetting that he is an old
  </p>
  <p>
   man, he doesn’t consider any youthful activities to be off-limits to him. He loves, drinks,
  </p>
  <p>
   sings, dances, and although he is gray-haired, knock-kneed, hunchbacked, big-
  </p>
  <p>
   mouthed, stocky, dark, and has bad breath, he (amazingly) bests many excellent young
  </p>
  <p>
   men in the contest of love—his only weapon being money, which, along with his other
  </p>
  <p>
   assets, improves both his social standing and his looks. This mark of folly is
  </p>
  <p>
   compensated by dint of his many great virtues. He is an eminent philosopher, physician,
  </p>
  <p>
   poet, and orator, and if he visited this sick person, whom we are on our way to see, he
  </p>
  <p>
   would immediately diagnose what kind of illness he has and would prescribe a fitting
  </p>
  <p>
   cure for it.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While we were discussing these things and laughing, we arrived at the sick
  </p>
  <p>
   man’s house. When we entered, we saw him looking pale, gloomy, and deep in thought.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius asked him why he was so confounded and pale. “Because,” he replied, “I am
  </p>
  <p>
   consumed by an extraordinary, unparalleled, and bitter grief in my soul.” Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   asked whether he had committed some serious crime for which he feared receiving
  </p>
  <p>
   judgment and punishment. He said he had not. Gallonius asked whether he had
  </p>
  <p>
   incurred a debt so large that he couldn’t pay it off. He denied this as well. Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   pressed on, inquiring whether he had cosigned a loan for another person, or whether he
  </p>
  <p>
   had suffered a loss of his family’s estate because of fire, shipwreck, or catastrophe. “It is
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing of the sort,” he responded. “Out with it,” said Gallonius. “What is causing you
  </p>
  <p>
   such misery?” “It’s simply that I feel like old age is already upon me and, as a
  </p>
  <p>
   327
  </p>
  <p>
   consequence, that death is drawing near. This worry has penetrated so deeply into my
  </p>
  <p>
   thoughts that I cannot shake it. It’s pressing so hard on my mind that I can find no
  </p>
  <p>
   relief.” Then Gallonius exclaimed: “Off with you to where you deserve to go with that
  </p>
  <p>
   absurd foolishness of yours! Certainly, if there were a king of all idiots who ever existed
  </p>
  <p>
   anywhere on earth, in my opinion nobody would surpass you.” The man took exception
  </p>
  <p>
   to this: “To be sure, it is now you, sir, who are driving me mad. Do you think it’s insane
  </p>
  <p>
   to ponder the troubles of old age and to tremble at the inevitability of death that
  </p>
  <p>
   follows?” Gallonius replied: “Tell me, what do you accomplish by worrying and fretting?
  </p>
  <p>
   Does it enable you to avoid old age and death? You don’t delay old age, even the
  </p>
  <p>
   slightest bit, by tormenting and torturing yourself and by making yourself the most
  </p>
  <p>
   miserable of all miserable men; rather you bring old age and death on sooner. So why
  </p>
  <p>
   do you insist on being miserable when there is no point to it? Why don’t you put aside
  </p>
  <p>
   this worry that is tormenting you and happily grasp the gifts of the present moment?”
  </p>
  <p>
   “How can I be happy while thinking about my death?” he protested. “Woe is me,
  </p>
  <p>
   whenever I think about the time that will soon be upon me when I am at death’s door.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “What if death takes you before you reach old age?” asked Gallonius. “Who can ever be
  </p>
  <p>
   sure that he will live until the evening?” “You’re right,” the man said. “Indeed, if death
  </p>
  <p>
   can hear me, let him come free my mind of this anguish.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius exclaimed: “This man deserves to be shackled with heavy chains! You
  </p>
  <p>
   want what you fear, yet you hope that the thing that is causing you worry will bring an
  </p>
  <p>
   end to your worries. First, explain to me whether you consider death to be good or bad.
  </p>
  <p>
   If it’s good, why are you anxious? If it’s bad, why do you think that it will bring about the
  </p>
  <p>
   end of bad things? A thing cannot be counted as bad if it puts an end to bad things. As
  </p>
  <p>
   328
  </p>
  <p>
   God is my witness, how I pity your foolishness. Since you were bound to go insane, at
  </p>
  <p>
   least a type of insanity befell you that is happy, witty, and cheerful. You should therefore
  </p>
  <p>
   seek out happiness for yourself and prepare entertainments for us, instead of creating
  </p>
  <p>
   trouble for the both of us, as you are currently doing.” Then the man said: “What? Are
  </p>
  <p>
   you making fun of me? Are you the only one who is so sound of mind that you lack just
  </p>
  <p>
   about any trace of foolishness? You are mistaken. There is no intelligence so great that
  </p>
  <p>
   it doesn’t leave room for some measure of foolishness.” Gallonius answered him saying:
  </p>
  <p>
   “I concede the point to you. Moreover, I do not regret my own foolishness (whatever sort
  </p>
  <p>
   it is that I am now engaged in), since I observe that others are trapped in a sort of
  </p>
  <p>
   foolishness that is even more wretched and troublesome. But if you insist on being
  </p>
  <p>
   foolish, I don’t see what limit or end there will be to your foolishness. Although time
  </p>
  <p>
   heals other illnesses, the sickness that is connected to your getting older will grow
  </p>
  <p>
   greater by the day; and as much as is added to your years, that same amount will also
  </p>
  <p>
   be added to your pointless distress.” Then the man said: “Leave me to my misery and
  </p>
  <p>
   don’t add any more troubles to those my illness is already causing.” Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   responded: “Since we have troubled you with our interruption, we will do as you wish.
  </p>
  <p>
   We will take our leave. But I caution you not to send for me in the future, because you
  </p>
  <p>
   will have summoned me in vain. And since you delight in misery, I pray to god that you
  </p>
  <p>
   will always be miserable.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Without saying another word, Gallonius rushed outside and turned his attention
  </p>
  <p>
   to showing us the important sites of the city such as sacred temples, theaters,
  </p>
  <p>
   colonnades, marketplaces, gymnasiums, and private homes. One of these homes was
  </p>
  <p>
   large and stately and displayed the following words out front carved in large letters:
  </p>
  <p>
   329
  </p>
  <p>
   The master of this house bestows no benefit, favor, or money on those
  </p>
  <p>
   who work here, other than their pay. Let this be stated in advance lest they
  </p>
  <p>
   later complain that they have been deceived.
  </p>
  <p>
   To which I remarked: “I praise the frank and open nature of a man who doesn’t tolerate
  </p>
  <p>
   anyone, who might be seized by some vain hope, wasting his energy at his house.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius replied: “You would be even more convinced of that if you knew how well he
  </p>
  <p>
   keeps his promises. Although, as you see, he openly reveals his true self, nevertheless
  </p>
  <p>
   it is incredible to recount how many rich people from noble households seek this house
  </p>
  <p>
   out whenever word gets around that his household staff is in need of additional
  </p>
  <p>
   members. The dynasts are so revered here that everyone thinks it an honor to dedicate
  </p>
  <p>
   himself to their service, even without such a hope. Everyone believes, however, that
  </p>
  <p>
   both fortune and prosperity conspire against whomever either will or fate pushes to join
  </p>
  <p>
   their household.”
  </p>
  <p>
   A wail and a cry interrupted him as he was speaking and, when we turned
  </p>
  <p>
   around, we saw a rag seller in the Forum of Cupid selling his cheap wares to the crowd:
  </p>
  <p>
   This poor man fills the air with dreadful sounding complaints and rends his
  </p>
  <p>
   bare chest with his fierce hand; his son weeps, as do his daughters with
  </p>
  <p>
   their sad brother; his excited dog barks at the top of its lungs. It seems as
  </p>
  <p>
   if fierce Brennus himself has cruelly set fire to Roman houses51 or that
  </p>
  <p>
   Troy and the ancient riches of Priam’s father, King of Troy, has been
  </p>
  <p>
   overcome by the trickery and the sword of the Greeks and the Dolopes.52
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, because there has been entirely too much disturbance, the entire
  </p>
  <p>
   neighborhood protests and rushes to offer help the afflicted man asking:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Where are the thieves? Where is the horrible mob, the robbers who
  </p>
  <p>
   51 Brennus was the chieftain of a Gallic tribe who led an army of Gauls to sack Rome. They captured
  </p>
  <p>
   most of the city and held it for several months setting many buildings on fire.
  </p>
  <p>
   52 In the accounts of the Fall of Troy, Virgil is the only author who mentions the Dolopes, which he does
  </p>
  <p>
   four times in book two of the Aeneid (Paschalis 1997: 99).
  </p>
  <p>
   330
  </p>
  <p>
   plundered your home?’ What did they find that ignited such chaos in the
  </p>
  <p>
   old man? A quarter of an as,53 which a boy thief carried off.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rag seller’s wife was not among the crowd of mourners. They said that she
  </p>
  <p>
   had confined and locked herself up in her home with some shopkeeper whom she, with
  </p>
  <p>
   her husband’s knowledge, had attached to herself as a bodyguard and companion; and
  </p>
  <p>
   that she had done so because of some apprehension or other, or certain pointless
  </p>
  <p>
   fears, which she was afraid would take hold of her while her husband was tied up with
  </p>
  <p>
   his business commitments in the public square. Because of this, she feared nothing
  </p>
  <p>
   more than being alone. But the shopkeeper, aroused by the rag seller’s cries, was
  </p>
  <p>
   agitated indeed and was reluctantly torn away from the woman’s side. He ran to the
  </p>
  <p>
   forum to protect his colleague’s belongings and his own life, just as he had been
  </p>
  <p>
   protecting his colleague’s wife. He arrived, pushed himself into the crowd, inquired
  </p>
  <p>
   about the cause of the disturbance, and discovered that this whole crowd of people had
  </p>
  <p>
   formed because a thief had made off with a quarter of an as. Therefore, freed from a
  </p>
  <p>
   great worry, he fished a drachma out of his pouch and gave it to the rag seller. Happy
  </p>
  <p>
   that his quarter had been replaced by a drachma, the rag seller returned to his
  </p>
  <p>
   interrupted work, and the shopkeeper returned to guarding the fearful wife.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rag seller had another rival too, a young man who was still under his father’s
  </p>
  <p>
   legal control. This young man was desperately in love with the same woman, but his
  </p>
  <p>
   father’s stinginess and the lex quinavicenaria54 ensured that he had nothing to offer her.
  </p>
  <p>
   He had no other option than to feast his eyes on her, follow her, and betake himself
  </p>
  <p>
   repeatedly to the temples of the gods. And it didn’t so much annoy him that the woman
  </p>
  <p>
   53 as: a copper coin of negligible value.
  </p>
  <p>
   54 Under Roman law, sons could not legally enter into contracts until twenty-five years of age.
  </p>
  <p>
   331
  </p>
  <p>
   wasn’t his, as much as it irked him that she belonged to another. If given the choice, he
  </p>
  <p>
   would have opted to live his entire life without her rather than to suffer her spending a
  </p>
  <p>
   single day with another man. For this reason, beset simultaneously by love and
  </p>
  <p>
   jealously, he kept trying to lead the shopkeeper to suspect his rival, the rag seller, of
  </p>
  <p>
   adultery. He used these words preferring to present himself as righteous rather than
  </p>
  <p>
   hateful:
  </p>
  <p>
   What strange and laughable naiveté is this, husband, to place your wife
  </p>
  <p>
   and her lover together? When evening beckons you home, don’t you see
  </p>
  <p>
   the traces of this stranger in your bed? Everyone is talking about it. Don’t
  </p>
  <p>
   you hear the gossip, don’t you see that everyone’s eyes are turned toward
  </p>
  <p>
   your shameful actions? Only a stupid and gutless lover would allow
  </p>
  <p>
   convenient meeting times to slip away in vain. The Trojan guest laid claim
  </p>
  <p>
   to the daughter of Tyndareus55 while her husband hurried to set sail for
  </p>
  <p>
   Crete with favorable winds. But if your wife’s beauty frightens you, entrust
  </p>
  <p>
   her to me. Only then, my good man, will you be safe. You will be able to
  </p>
  <p>
   set out for whatever faraway lands you wish, and you shall fear no
  </p>
  <p>
   treachery. My head will sooner leave this neck of mine than violate your
  </p>
  <p>
   sacred marriage. It is not beneath me to keep perpetual watch outside
  </p>
  <p>
   your dear doorway; I am not reluctant to get into a fight. Whether the
  </p>
  <p>
   freezing air resounds with the swift North winds, or a sudden rainstorm
  </p>
  <p>
   pours down copious water, I am not unwilling to bear the harsh
  </p>
  <p>
   inconveniences of winter, nor am I unwilling to lay my tired body upon the
  </p>
  <p>
   bare ground. My drawn sword will guard my side, and its concern will not
  </p>
  <p>
   be lessened by long-lasting toil. Wherever my feet take me, I will follow
  </p>
  <p>
   her, whether she expresses a wish to visit the temples of the Gods, or
  </p>
  <p>
   whether she desires to return home.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rag seller didn’t tolerate him speaking any longer, but said: “With a single
  </p>
  <p>
   action, I will put an end to the efforts of two people: you talking, and me listening. I don’t
  </p>
  <p>
   put any more stock in your fancy words and promises than I do in bird feathers or
  </p>
  <p>
   dandelion seeds.56 They won’t make me even one penny richer. I don’t need anyone
  </p>
  <p>
   55 Helen of Troy.
  </p>
  <p>
   56 The Latin is pappos volantes; L&amp;S translates pappus as the “wooly, hairy seed of certain plants.” I
  </p>
  <p>
   chose to translate this as “dandelion seeds” because of the image evoked when the seeds are blown on
  </p>
  <p>
   and fly away.
  </p>
  <p>
   332
  </p>
  <p>
   guarding my wife’s flank from foreign invaders because my house is full of such guards.
  </p>
  <p>
   But I do need someone to bring those guards money and rations. And, as you know,
  </p>
  <p>
   when the person you are trying to make me jealous of comes to my house, he never
  </p>
  <p>
   comes empty-handed. He brings bags of money, piles of wheat, meats, cheeses, and
  </p>
  <p>
   sacks of olives with him. Therefore, as long as he is useful to me, I’d rather he stay. You
  </p>
  <p>
   can go look for someone else to guard—I dismiss guards like you.” While he was
  </p>
  <p>
   making fun of the young man, he turned his back on him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius then said: “I think we should go home because after lunch I plan to
  </p>
  <p>
   take you to the house of a certain nobleman where, every fortnight, many learned men
  </p>
  <p>
   gather to practice and show off their talents. But, in regard to that nobleman, do not
  </p>
  <p>
   suppose that there is anyone more perfect than he in terms of physical or mental
  </p>
  <p>
   qualities. As a boy (and he was by far the most handsome of his generation) he sought
  </p>
  <p>
   out friendships with scholars, and, once obtained, he maintained them faithfully. He was
  </p>
  <p>
   so devoted to the intellectual practice of those learned men that he saw fit to convene
  </p>
  <p>
   and establish out of that group an organization called an academy.57 Since there is no
  </p>
  <p>
   organization that can maintain itself without a leader, a single person was put in charge
  </p>
  <p>
   of that academy, who was connected to it like the head is to the limbs on a body.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to their ancient custom, these intellectuals are bound, even today, to convene
  </p>
  <p>
   at this nobleman’s house, where you will also see his two sons who are outstanding in
  </p>
  <p>
   age, intelligence, and looks, but even more illustrious in their wisdom and uprightness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their father did not raise them according to the habits that are currently in vogue, but
  </p>
  <p>
   according to the best and most venerable traditional education, meaning that the boys
  </p>
  <p>
   57 A reference to the Academia Humoristarum, or Accademia degli Umoristi.
  </p>
  <p>
   333
  </p>
  <p>
   are never found partaking in any of the vices that are typically associated with
  </p>
  <p>
   adolescence. Indeed, their entire education is lauded as exemplary and worthy of a
  </p>
  <p>
   nobleman who, at leisure from more difficult tasks such as work, does not give himself
  </p>
  <p>
   over to listlessness and pleasures, but devotes himself instead to these most delightful
  </p>
  <p>
   studies, as if entering a garden, and to this most noble form of diversion. On the days
  </p>
  <p>
   that they convene their gathering of learned men, each of the participants comes up to
  </p>
  <p>
   the podium and recites, before the other academy members who are seated directly
  </p>
  <p>
   below him, a passage of prose, a poem, or something of that sort that is worthy of
  </p>
  <p>
   learned ears. After each person has had a turn, the head of the academy solicits songs
  </p>
  <p>
   or epigrams as if requiring payment from his guests, and they recite aloud something
  </p>
  <p>
   they have just composed on the spot. Since the two of you are devoted to this most
  </p>
  <p>
   tasteful kind of study, I will bring you along with me. Everyone is welcome. But for now,
  </p>
  <p>
   in the meantime, make yourselves at home and wait for me to return. I have to bring my
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast some things he needs so his lunch can be prepared. We will eat the leftovers
  </p>
  <p>
   later.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius left and came back. On his way back, he ran into someone he knew.
  </p>
  <p>
   That man had clung to his side and Gallonius had not been able to shake him off, even
  </p>
  <p>
   after he had already arrived at home. Holding fast to him the man said: “I am eating
  </p>
  <p>
   lunch at your house today.” Gallonius, by way of brushing him off, said “You must be
  </p>
  <p>
   teasing and joking with me. I’ll be damned if I went shopping for your sake.” “No need,”
  </p>
  <p>
   he replied. “It’s all planned; I am supposed to be here today.” As he was talking, he put
  </p>
  <p>
   down his coat, removed his sword from around his waist, took off his shoes, and went to
  </p>
  <p>
   recline at the table. Gallonius (it is hard to keep on fighting once you have been
  </p>
  <p>
   334
  </p>
  <p>
   defeated) threw up his hands and gave in. “Have it your way,” he said, “but you will be
  </p>
  <p>
   received in such an informal manner that you will regret having come.” So as not to
  </p>
  <p>
   seem as if Gallonius was inviting him unwillingly, the man showed his face and started
  </p>
  <p>
   laughing. The man’s dishonesty and gluttony were evident in the way he grabbed
  </p>
  <p>
   everything single thing that looked best, shoved it in his mouth, devoured it, and filled
  </p>
  <p>
   himself with wine. After he had eaten his fill and gotten himself drunk, he took his feet
  </p>
  <p>
   off the couch, put his shoes on, asked for his cloak and sword, arranged them on his
  </p>
  <p>
   shoulder and around his waist, and, after saying goodbye to Gallonius, he left. After he
  </p>
  <p>
   had gone, we passed the afternoon in conversation on various topics. Admiring the
  </p>
  <p>
   impudence and voracity of the man, I couldn’t contain myself from asking what sort of
  </p>
  <p>
   man would come over to destroy another person’s meals with such force. Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   replied: “He is from this very town and contracts his services to the same dynast as I do.
  </p>
  <p>
   But if you judge men like that, who spend time at court, by their appearance and dress,
  </p>
  <p>
   they will seem like they have a lot of money; but if you take a good look at their assets,
  </p>
  <p>
   you will find that they are emptier than a hollow nut. I tolerate him weaseling lunches out
  </p>
  <p>
   of me more out of a sense of pity than because I feel forced to. Maybe that poor man
  </p>
  <p>
   has nothing to eat at home. Since we have relaxed enough, I think we should set off to
  </p>
  <p>
   where we planned to go.”
  </p>
  <p>
   After this brief digression we arrived at the nobleman’s house. It was situated in
  </p>
  <p>
   the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the city where, during certain hours of
  </p>
  <p>
   the day, most members of the nobility bustle about to and fro for their own amusement.
  </p>
  <p>
   The name of the master of the house was carved in capital letters on the front of the
  </p>
  <p>
   335
  </p>
  <p>
   palace: LUCIUS MINUCIUS SINISTER.58 A fountain stood before us as we entered, situated
  </p>
  <p>
   in the middle of a most elegant garden. A figure of Pegasus, carved out of marble and
  </p>
  <p>
   flanked by Phoebus and the Muses, was beating the earth with his hoof and sending a
  </p>
  <p>
   large quantity of water up into the air.59 There was an epigram at the base of this
  </p>
  <p>
   sculpture group, written by the scholar Aridus,60 in honor of the master of the house:
  </p>
  <p>
   That there may be a place here—where the air resounds sweetly with
  </p>
  <p>
   swan-song, where Lucius establishes a new Helicon,61 and where
  </p>
  <p>
   Pegasus’s hard hoof brings forth a spring, famous for its leaping waters—
  </p>
  <p>
   where you, Muses, and you, proud Phoebus with your tortoiseshell lyre,
  </p>
  <p>
   may raise your master to the heavens, whenever he is oppressed by an
  </p>
  <p>
   extraordinary burden: this is the purpose of your art, Phoebus and
  </p>
  <p>
   Pierides.
  </p>
  <p>
   After we had sufficiently feasted our eyes on that pleasing and beautiful sight, we
  </p>
  <p>
   arrived in a great hall that was decorated and filled on all sides with paintings chiefly
  </p>
  <p>
   honoring the academy’s tutelary deity.62 Another painting depicted a virgin goddess
  </p>
  <p>
   sitting atop many books and holding a trumpet in her left hand, and at her feet lay two
  </p>
  <p>
   dead monkeys. The virgin represented the academy and the dead monkeys, in turn,
  </p>
  <p>
   represented academies that had been established to emulate the academy that we
  </p>
  <p>
   were visiting, but had died out in short order due to unlucky auspices.63 On either side of
  </p>
  <p>
   58 Paolo Mancini (1580-1637) was a founding member of the Accademia degli Umoristi. His house, where
  </p>
  <p>
   academy meetings were originally held, was located in the Via del Corso. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. I n. 7.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi devotes a portrait to Mancini in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   59 Reference to Hippocrene, a spring on Mount Helicon that was formed by the hooves of Pegasus.
  </p>
  <p>
   60 Possibly Rossi himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   61 Mount Helicon, located in Boeotia, Greece, was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.
  </p>
  <p>
   62 The patron saint of the real Accademia degli Umoristi was Gregory the Great.
  </p>
  <p>
   63 Gerboni (1899: 121) identifies one of these defunct academies as the short-lived Accademia degli
  </p>
  <p>
   Ordinati founded in 1608 by Giulio Strozzi in “ostile contrapposizione a quella degli Umoristi” (“as a hostile
  </p>
  <p>
   counterpart to the Umoristi”); he does not identify the second. Maylender and Rava (1976, vol. 5: 374; vol.
  </p>
  <p>
   336
  </p>
  <p>
   the great hall hung paintings depicting two illustrious members of the academy, one of
  </p>
  <p>
   whom, Bellinus,64 had published a famous eclogue that everybody reads today; and the
  </p>
  <p>
   other, Thalassicus, had composed many books of excellent verses, in one of which he
  </p>
  <p>
   celebrated the story of Adonis in an outstanding poem.65 All of the paintings were
  </p>
  <p>
   adorned with gold wreaths. Above the dais, where the academy members declaimed
  </p>
  <p>
   (which was accessed via a staircase on either side), hung the emblem of the academy
  </p>
  <p>
   painted by the celebrated hand of the artist Arpinas.66 Emblems of individual academy
  </p>
  <p>
   members decorated the rest of the walls. Through these emblems each academy
  </p>
  <p>
   member, with the addition of a brief motto, endeavored to demonstrate and call
  </p>
  <p>
   attention to the benefits accrued to him from his academic contributions. The emblems
  </p>
  <p>
   were so fitting and so elegant that there was no way we could sate or fill our spirits and
  </p>
  <p>
   our eyes by examining them.67
  </p>
  <p>
   Because a crowd was starting to gather, we went and sat down, fearing that the
  </p>
  <p>
   seats would fill up if we just stood there staring. At which point a certain haggard old

  <p>
   4: 16) also mention a certain Accademia dei Malinconici that was founded in 1614 when the membership
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Umoristi grew too large.
  </p>
  <p>
   64 Giovanni Battista Guarini (1538-1612) was an Italian poet and dramatist most famous for Il pastor fido.
  </p>
  <p>
   He served as Principe of the Accademia degli Umoristi from 1611 until his death the following year
  </p>
  <p>
   (Alemanno 1995: 108). Rossi devotes a portrait to Guarini in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   65 Giambattista Marino (1569-1625) was an Italian poet, born in Naples, who is considered to be the
  </p>
  <p>
   founder of the Mannerist style of poetry. He is most well known for his epic poem L’Adone published in
  </p>
  <p>
   1623. He was a member of the Accademia degli Umoristi with Rossi and served as its Principe from
  </p>
  <p>
   1623-25. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 8. Rossi devotes a portrait to Marino in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   66 Giuseppe Cesari (1568-1640), also known as Il Giuseppino and called Il Cavaliere d'Arpino, was an
  </p>
  <p>
   Italian Mannerist painter.
  </p>
  <p>
   67 An art form that gained popularity in the sixteenth century, emblems consist of a picture, a motto, and
  </p>
  <p>
   sometimes an explanatory text. The presence of many emblems in Rossi’s description of Eudemia’s
  </p>
  <p>
   literary academy is a reflection of their ubiquity. As John Manning (2002: 16, 25) explains, “Without
  </p>
  <p>
   exaggeration, from Catholic Spain to the Protestant Netherlands and from Englad to Russia the emblem
  </p>
  <p>
   impinged on every aspect of European Renaissance and Baroque life—and death . . . No domestic or
  </p>
  <p>
   public space was left unfilled by some appropriate emblematic decoration.”
  </p>
  <p>
   337
  </p>
  <p>
   man caught our eye. He was running around here and there asking this person to come
  </p>
  <p>
   in, talking in that person’s ear, leading another person to his seat, intercepting another
  </p>
  <p>
   person, and not pausing for even a little bit. I asked who that man was, who was so
  </p>
  <p>
   busy and restless that he never stopped moving. Gallonius told me that he was a
  </p>
  <p>
   certain Salvius Tifernas,68 a colleague of Lucius Minucius, upon whose care and
  </p>
  <p>
   diligence the weight of the entire academy depended. He signified only one thing to the
  </p>
  <p>
   academy: τὰ πάντα.69 He told me that they praised Tifernas especially for the
  </p>
  <p>
   enthusiasm with which he sought out and recognized each scholar, embraced him in
  </p>
  <p>
   friendship, maintained each one’s regard for him through his attentiveness, and
  </p>
  <p>
   obligated everyone to himself with his services and favors. Because of this he neglected
  </p>
  <p>
   his own affairs, while taking care of everyone else’s, and was just about reduced to
  </p>
  <p>
   poverty. But it is everyone’s firm opinion that the academy exists today solely because
  </p>
  <p>
   of his effort and diligence. He frequently goes around to the house of every single
  </p>
  <p>
   academy member to greet him, bring him here, and accompany him back home. He
  </p>
  <p>
   single-handedly sees to it that these scholarly gatherings are well attended.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Gallonius was talking, Salvius appeared out of nowhere and was reading
  </p>
  <p>
   to a man named Cuminus, who had a dark face and black hair and was holding a
  </p>
  <p>
   writing tablet in his hands. “What did you think of that speech in which Obtusus praised
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing?” “It was elegant and pleasing,” he replied. “But I am glad he decided to come

   68 Gaspare Salviani. Rossi refers to Salviani as τὰ πάντα, i.e., the person on whom the entire academy
  </p>
  <p>
   depends, because he was apparently the guiding force, along with Mancini, behind its creation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tiraboschi (1780: 34) describes Salviani as the academy’s “più fervido promotore” (“most fervid

  <p>
   refers to Gaspare Salviani as “decan de l’Accademia de’ Mancini” in canto XI.XLI of his mock-heroic epic
  </p>
  <p>
   poem La secchia rapita. Rossi also calls Salviani “Tifernas” in his portrait of him in the Pinacotheca.

  <p>
   here, especially on my account. I used to worry that I was considered to be worth
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing, and, because of that, I strived diligently to become something. But now, since it
  </p>
  <p>
   is thought that there is such gravitas and distinction in nothing, I am no longer sorry; on
  </p>
  <p>
   the contrary, I thoroughly rejoice in being nothing. But if Obtusus were given the option
  </p>
  <p>
   to choose which to be, I suspect that he would prefer to be nothing rather than
  </p>
  <p>
   Caesar.70 But please, hand me a pen; I want to express my thoughts in verse at the
  </p>
  <p>
   bottom of this tablet”:71
  </p>
  <p>
   CUMINUS TO OBTUSUS, GREETINGS. I used to become aggrieved and red in
  </p>
  <p>
   the face if anyone said I was nothing. Now, Obtusus, since your writings
  </p>
  <p>
   praise nothing, I am neither sorry nor ashamed to be nothing. But may I
  </p>
  <p>
   drop dead if you would prefer to be utterly nothing, even though you have
  </p>
  <p>
   the ability to be either Caesar or nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   When he had finished writing, he handed the tablet to Salvius who, in his usual hurried
  </p>
  <p>
   manner, made sure to take it to Obtusus and then bring it back. We, on the other hand,
  </p>
  <p>
   were seized by a strong desire to get to know everyone, and we wanted to know what
  </p>
  <p>
   kind of a person this Cuminus was. We found out that he was learned in Greek and
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin, and that he spoke Greek so well that he seemed to know no other language.
  </p>
  <p>
   70 “Aut Caesar aut nihil” (“either Caesar or nothing” or “all or nothing”) was a motto adopted most
  </p>
  <p>
   famously by the Italian nobleman, politician, and cardinal Cesare Borgia (1475-1507).
  </p>
  <p>
   71 The following poem is the first of a series of paradoxical encomia (poems in praise of mundane or
  </p>
  <p>
   unexpected subjects) recited at this gathering. Paradoxical encomia on the topic of nothing (de nihilo)
  </p>
  <p>
   have existed since the middle ages (Lehmann 1922: 244-5) but they gained immense popularity in the
  </p>
  <p>
   seventeenth century after the publication of Jean Passerat’s satirical poem Nihil (Paris: Chez Estienne
  </p>
  <p>
   Preuosteau, 1587). Carlo Ossola (1997: vii-xxvii) describes a vigorous two-year-long debate in the
  </p>
  <p>
   Venetian Accademia degli Incogniti regarding the value of such poems, which was initiated by the
  </p>
  <p>
   publication of a discourse by Luigi Manzini titled Il niente (Venice: Andrea Baba, 1634). Ossola (xliii-xlv)
  </p>
  <p>
   convincingly demonstrates that Rossi’s friend Gabriel Naudé was in Padua during the time of these
  </p>
  <p>
   debates, which were associated with Venetian intellectuals, and cultivated an interest in paradoxical
  </p>
  <p>
   encomia, including Nothing-poems. The following poems include ones on such subjects as a gnat, a
  </p>
  <p>
   honey apple, a pomegranate, and a beard.

  </p>
  <p>
   We would have learned more about him had exuberant laughter, coming from the
  </p>
  <p>
   people sitting next to us, not directed our curiosity elsewhere. They were ridiculing the
  </p>
  <p>
   ability and acumen of a certain philosopher72 in their group, who had supposedly
  </p>
  <p>
   discovered that all dense and solid bodies were transparent, something he attempted to
  </p>
  <p>
   demonstrate in the following way: He moved his right hand back and forth over his left
  </p>
  <p>
   hand at such speed that the brief period of time when his right hand, which was in
  </p>
  <p>
   motion, was covering up his left hand was not perceptible to the naked eye; because of
  </p>
  <p>
   this his left hand was always visible. The philosopher, either not noticing this, or
  </p>
  <p>
   pretending not to notice, concluded his reasoning thus: “Is my right hand not a dense
  </p>
  <p>
   and solid body? As it moves quickly back and forth it covers the left hand, but it
  </p>
  <p>
   nevertheless does not remove it from sight. Therefore, are not all solid and dense
  </p>
  <p>
   bodies transparent?” He failed to understand that the movement of his right hand was
  </p>
  <p>
   creating an optical illusion, and that, if his right hand remained motionless above his left
  </p>
  <p>
   hand, it would cover it in such a way that you wouldn’t be able to see it. Moreover, he
  </p>
  <p>
   taught us that the earth was liquid and that all living things moved about in it like fish:
  </p>
  <p>
   “What else could those little objects be that you see floating about in sunrays, as if in
  </p>
  <p>
   water, if not little particles of earth? Therefore, the earth alone fills these lower parts and
  </p>
  <p>
   surrounds everything that moves.”
  </p>
  <p>
   But we were not going to hear such things from the person who was about to
  </p>
  <p>
   speak, since he always conveyed ideas that sprung from his genius, were elaborated by
  </p>
  <p>
   72 Giovanni Ciampoli (1589-1643) was at one point made papal poet laureate (Rietbergen 2006: 108). He
  </p>
  <p>
   lost his position as secretary of the Papal Briefs in the 1630s because he was an admirer of Galileo
  </p>
  <p>
   Galilei. Rossi devotes a portrait to Ciampoli in his Pinacotheca altera.

  <p>
   exacting effort, and honed by good judgment. That man is Hiero Volusius73 who is first
  </p>
  <p>
   and foremost learned, is an expert in divine and human law,74 as well as in Greek and
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin letters, and is refined in all manner of learning. He has published many
  </p>
  <p>
   outstanding books in both prose and poetry, and, though he has distinguished himself,
  </p>
  <p>
   he has not attained the highest honors, which frequently happens to the best people in
  </p>
  <p>
   this Republic.75 While we were listening to these things, and more, about this man, he
  </p>
  <p>
   appeared at the podium. His face was honest, albeit gaunt and a bit pale from the toil of
  </p>
  <p>
   study; because his eyesight was weak, it was shielded behind spectacles, which made
  </p>
  <p>
   him look authoritative rather than deformed. He proceeded to praise a gnat76 with such
  </p>
  <p>
   erudition and eloquence, with phrases so skillfully joined together and so elegant, that it
  </p>
  <p>
   was judged, by the consent of all, that nothing more perfect or more excellent had ever
  </p>
  <p>
   been heard in that venue. After he had concluded his recitation, he stepped off the dais
  </p>
  <p>
   and went to sit with everyone else. The Prince of the Academy,77 a most noble youth—a
  </p>
  <p>
   redhead of the highest birth, the greatest intelligence, and who had risen quickly in his
  </p>
  <p>
   career because, at the age when others were considering embarking on their studies,
  </p>
  <p>
   73 Girolamo Aleandro, the younger (1574-1629), was the grand-nephew of Cardinal Girolamo Aleandro
  </p>
  <p>
   (1480-1542). He studied law at Padova and entered the service of Cardinal Francesco Barberini. He was
  </p>
  <p>
   an active and influential member in Roman literary circles and was a member of the Accademia degli
  </p>
  <p>
   Umoristi at the same time as Rossi. Both the first and second edition of Eudemia are dedicated
  </p>
  <p>
   posthumously to him. Rossi devotes a portrait to Aleandro in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   75 This judgment regarding the republic is made in the first-person voice of the narrator, Vopsicus Niger,
  </p>
  <p>
   which is unusual. He is not a native of the country and, in general, the criticisms of the republic are
  </p>
  <p>
   overheard by him but spoken by others.
  </p>
  <p>
   76 A poem titled Culex is one of the works in the Appendix Vergiliana, a collection of poems traditionally
  </p>
  <p>
   ascribed to Virgil as part of his youthful writings (iuvenilia) but are now considered to be spurious. John
  </p>
  <p>
   Donne also wrote a poem called The Flea, which was published posthumously in 1633.

  </p>
  <p>
   341
  </p>
  <p>
   he had already completed them—began asking everybody, one at a time, to bring any
  </p>
  <p>
   new poems forward, if they had any. Specifically, he called on Plusius Accipiter,78
  </p>
  <p>
   whose hair was gray but whose mind and demeanor were not at all that of an old man.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was said to be a witty conversationalist, lively, pleasant, affable, a friend to his
  </p>
  <p>
   friends; and he was an especially delightful poet, both melodious and charming. In a
  </p>
  <p>
   clear, sweet voice he recited this six-line poem, which he had written in honor of a
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden to whom he had sent honey apples as a gift:
  </p>
  <p>
   We apples blush with red and are brimming, smooth and heavy, with
  </p>
  <p>
   honey. At the same time, we grow old after a brief life. Our rosy hue
  </p>
  <p>
   forsakes us and ugly wrinkles take its place. Wrinkles await you in the
  </p>
  <p>
   same way, maiden; the destiny of old age will descend upon you, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   pretty blush of your cheeks will fall away.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since it was customary in this academy to repeat everything so that, if something
  </p>
  <p>
   was not understood the first time around, it could be absorbed more precisely when
  </p>
  <p>
   presented again, I had plenty of time to take in what was being said. Nicobulus Aridus79
  </p>
  <p>
   was invited to speak next, and he praised the late Claudius Magius—famous among
  </p>
  <p>
   academy members both in reputation and name, and who had once presided over the
  </p>
  <p>
   academy—with a poem, in which (in my opinion) he cleverly poked fun at the
  </p>
  <p>
   academy’s emblem, which was a magnificent fountain with many swans swimming in its
  </p>
  <p>
   lucid waters.80 Because he began speaking so quietly that he could barely be heard,
  </p>
  <p>
   even by those nearest to him, Plusius, with his usual charm, said: “Speak up, Nicobulus,
  </p>
  <p>
   so those at the back of the room can hear you.” Nicobulus complied:
  </p>
  <p>
   78 Enrico Falconio. Rossi devotes a portrait to Falconio in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   79 Gian Vittorio Rossi.
  </p>
  <p>
   80 The emblem of the Academia degli Umoristi consisted of an image of the sun partially obscured by
  </p>
  <p>
   precipitating clouds accompanied by the Lucretian motto “redit agmine dulci.”
  </p>
  <p>
   342
  </p>
  <p>
   While Magius sails the calm river to Elysium and the noble shade subdues
  </p>
  <p>
   and flees the funeral pyre, a dense crowd, hiding in the green forest,
  </p>
  <p>
   comes forth from all directions and is seen high atop the mountain ridges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The crowd of people does not know, but tries to find out, what sort of world
  </p>
  <p>
   the sailor is hastening to and whence the little boat is carrying its unusual
  </p>
  <p>
   cargo. But when they see Bellinus showering his old comrade with many
  </p>
  <p>
   kisses and see the two entwine their necks in an embrace, they discover
  </p>
  <p>
   that a great glory has flowed from these waters and has shone forth from
  </p>
  <p>
   these places. Their applause immediately increases and they utter the
  </p>
  <p>
   following sayings mixed with joyful dancing: “Surely if that river brings forth
  </p>
  <p>
   such shades, this grove81 will be more famous than heaven above.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When Nicobulus had finished speaking, Fabullus Leonatus,82 spontaneously and
  </p>
  <p>
   without waiting for the Prince’s order, said: “Nicobulus’s epigram reminds me of an ode
  </p>
  <p>
   with which I once eulogized that most famous poet Bellinus while mourning his death.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unless you deem otherwise, I will recite it to you here.” “As you like,” said the Prince.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Whatever you have to share will be beneficial.” Fabullus Leonatus began:
  </p>
  <p>
   Alas, what excellence has passed away and left the world behind! Alas,
  </p>
  <p>
   what lamentation has caused the air to resound! Bellinus has died, the
  </p>
  <p>
   love, delight, and darling of Phoebus. He has entered the vast region of
  </p>
  <p>
   heaven, as the fast flame climbs upward and the swift arrow takes leave of
  </p>
  <p>
   a bent bow. As the rent air cracks like a thunderbolt when an arrow leaves
  </p>
  <p>
   the bowstring, so the world cries out at the death of Bellinus who is
  </p>
  <p>
   returning to the stars. Installed in the ranks of the gods, he will be carried
  </p>
  <p>
   by the quick force of the resounding heavens and will be submerged, late,
  </p>
  <p>
   in the deep ocean. A new shooting star, trailing a white tail, shows how a
  </p>
  <p>
   noble virtue that serves the righteous gods now gleams among the eternal
  </p>
  <p>
   fires. Both Venus, blushing with ruddy hue, and Phoebus are glad to add
  </p>
  <p>
   him to their company and, by joining their light together, restore the losses
  </p>
  <p>
   of the night. Weave garlands of twining ivy, Delphic laurel, and green
  </p>
  <p>
   myrtle, and bring gifts of frankincense to the sacred tomb of that great
  </p>
  <p>
   poet. Let his lyre fly up to the stars, a lyre with sufficient skill to sound a
  </p>
  <p>
   song sweet enough to hold back the rivers in their banks, until an equal
  </p>
  <p>
   bard arises.

  </p>
  <p>
   343
  </p>
  <p>
   Lepidus Gallutius Sinister,83 son of Lucius Sinister, master of this palace, was
  </p>
  <p>
   seated near Fabullus. On account of his quickness of wit and the wealth of his
  </p>
  <p>
   education, he was admitted to their ranks just a few days earlier, which was sooner than
  </p>
  <p>
   the rules of the academy would normally allow. But everyone was exceedingly eager to
  </p>
  <p>
   get a taste of his intellect. Lepidus, either guided by gentlemanly modesty or because
  </p>
  <p>
   he was afraid of being subjected to the judgment of so many learned men, declined
  </p>
  <p>
   when asked to speak. After being persuaded by his friends, however, he finally said: “I
  </p>
  <p>
   will recite some verses that I allowed to slip out over the last few days while I was in the
  </p>
  <p>
   country. The beauty of that place, the healthfulness of the weather, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   peacefulness of the day inspired me to praise that most beautiful time of year”:
  </p>
  <p>
   Now let my shepherd’s pipe make the tender delights and joys of happy
  </p>
  <p>
   Spring resound in festive song, here where the lush lands, hills, and fields
  </p>
  <p>
   smile, which the blessed breeze of Favonius84 breathes on and clothes in
  </p>
  <p>
   snowy-white and red. O Spring, most excellent ornament, most shining
  </p>
  <p>
   splendor of the year, when the fields glimmer with a purple hue and the
  </p>
  <p>
   earth, sprinkled with pleasing flowers, dares, in her beauty, to compete
  </p>
  <p>
   with the starry sky; among which flowers white lilies, narcissus, and purple
  </p>
  <p>
   amaranth gleam, looking like goblets; and nature covers soft violets,
  </p>
  <p>
   tinged with the sweet paleness of lovers, with a rich variety of colors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, they are white and at the same time they look as if they are
  </p>
  <p>
   bleeding. The rose, suffused at its core with a maiden’s blush, turns red
  </p>
  <p>
   with a desire to hide its hair under a green cap, and at the same time to
  </p>
  <p>
   conceal its rosy countenance and, abiding in a maiden’s bosom, to glow or
  </p>
  <p>
   be plucked by the white thumb of an admiring boy. The playful girl opens
  </p>
  <p>
   her arms; then she slowly shakes the flower off her lap, tinged with its
  </p>
  <p>
   natural purple hue, and it colors the green grass of the sunny field. How a
  </p>
  <p>
   song sung by the delicate voice of birds drives away sad cares and brings
  </p>
  <p>
   back leisure! Colorful sirens of the grove—you peaceful birds—you
  </p>
  <p>
   captivate our anxious minds with your innocent songs; you compel us to
  </p>
  <p>
   wash off our unshaken spirits which sink their troubles in the secure

  </p>
  <p>
   into our stress-filled lives. Therefore, let my lands ever resound with your
  </p>
  <p>
   warbling; there will be no traps here, no bird-catchers with bird-lime.
  </p>
  <p>
   Melliferous swarms, with their delicate and peaceful hum, gather thyme or
  </p>
  <p>
   build their waxen homes. Shall I, forgetful of breathing the gently
  </p>
  <p>
   whispering heavenly air, be silent about your honors? How your sweet
  </p>
  <p>
   spirit strikes me coming right up close to my ears! How many scents reach
  </p>
  <p>
   my nose! Your spirit, traversing fragrant hills and Nabataean86 fields,
  </p>
  <p>
   brings back to me, in my heated state, sweet, pleasing gifts freely offered
  </p>
  <p>
   up by flowers.87 Stay, mild air, and grant this favor to my plot of land, that
  </p>
  <p>
   you will always hover over these leafy trees, and that they will shine, free
  </p>
  <p>
   of ice and rigid frost. Whether fierce Sirius scorches the thirsty fields, or
  </p>
  <p>
   snow and rain pull the sky along with their rumblings, there must be no
  </p>
  <p>
   shortage of flowers for bees, no shortage of roses, the garlands’ friend, or
  </p>
  <p>
   of long-lived celery, violets, or white lilies, or the privet, whiter than snow.
  </p>
  <p>
   The youth’s innate talent for poetry met with everyone’s approval, and there was a
  </p>
  <p>
   consensus that his eloquence, which was still sweet, lush, and in the process of
  </p>
  <p>
   fermenting, like must from the bottom of a wine barrel, would become much gentler and
  </p>
  <p>
   more pleasant as the years went by.
  </p>
  <p>
   Liberalis was up next, and he recited these two epigrams:
  </p>
  <p>
   Your swollen eyes pour forth diamonds, fierce love scorches your heart
  </p>
  <p>
   with a mighty flame. Is it any wonder that, shining through the air, your
  </p>
  <p>
   eyes emit double fires as their moisture glows greater? Similarly, we see
  </p>
  <p>
   stars imbued with a fine, reddish mist carrying burning torches.
  </p>
  <p>
   After he was silent for a bit he said: “I have praised the tears of another; now I will
  </p>
  <p>
   lament my own”:
  </p>
  <p>
   My heart is constantly aflame and my eyes are wet with copious moisture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Can my eyes bring forth clear spring waters, while my heart is emitting a
  </p>
  <p>
   flaming funeral pyre? Why does the rain shower of my tears not put out
  </p>
  <p>
   the swift flames, or the fire at least not drink down flowing waters? It is no
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   forgetfulness.

   86 Nabataeans were an Arab people who inhabited northern Arabia and the Southern Levant and whose
  </p>
  <p>
   kingdom was centred on Petra. They achieved great wealth by conveying luxury goods from southern
  </p>
  <p>
   Arabia to the Mediterranean.

  <p>
   wonder: cruel love combines two contraries, mixing rain with fire and fire
  </p>
  <p>
   with rain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the members of the academy, this man was considered a tragic poet and his
  </p>
  <p>
   writings were said to resound mightily like a battle trumpet; but from the epigrams he
  </p>
  <p>
   recited, we concluded that he possessed charm in equal amounts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sabellus88 followed up by saying: “Lepidus Sinister challenges me to recite
  </p>
  <p>
   another poem in which I praise the loveliness of this past Kalends of May”:89
  </p>
  <p>
   The joyous Kalends of the festive month has arrived. May is upon us,
  </p>
  <p>
   pride of the passing year. Behold Titan, bathed in rose-colored light,
  </p>
  <p>
   brings back bright, cloudless days. The tilled fields, painted with fragrant
  </p>
  <p>
   colors, prepare the lilies, together with violets, for new garlands. Young
  </p>
  <p>
   girls are spotted throughout the long byways, carrying white and purple
  </p>
  <p>
   roses in their aprons, and, at the same time, they lift up their hands and
  </p>
  <p>
   ask for gifts while piling green boughs on raised altars. Why is the whole
  </p>
  <p>
   year not decorated like this? Why is summer scorching hot? Why is winter
  </p>
  <p>
   savagely fierce? But the new spring renews your joys again and brings
  </p>
  <p>
   back beauty with its trees and plants. But as soon as our best years have
  </p>
  <p>
   faded away, every blossom and beauty are absent from our rough cheeks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Everybody praised his writing style, which was cheerful, bright, and charming,
  </p>
  <p>
   and we in the audience felt ourselves moved to joy. Then Sextilius Ligur,90 who was

   Allacci lists Paoli in his Apes urbanae describing him as the “Principis Sabellii a secretis” (secretary of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Prince Savelli), probably Giulio of the aristocratic Roman Savelli family (hence Paoli’s pseudonym here,
  </p>
  <p>

   90 Agostino Mascardi of Genova (1591-1640) was chamberlain to pope Urban VIII, who founded a
  </p>
  <p>
   professorship of rhetoric for him at the Sapienza in 1628. He was an active composer of poetry and verse
  </p>
  <p>
   and was a member of the Accademia degli Umoristi (where he served as its Principe in 1629 and 1631).
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi devotes a portrait to Mascardi in his Pinacotheca. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 10.

  </p>
  <p>
   on the Tablet of Cebes91 (besides his books of excellent epigrams and his brilliant
  </p>
  <p>
   speeches)—said: “The two noble minds that spoke before me extolled in their verses
  </p>
  <p>
   the riches and rewards of spring. But I understand that autumn surpasses spring to the
  </p>
  <p>
   extent that it produces more fruit than flowers and foliage, which I think is more
  </p>
  <p>
   important. What is more, I am closer to autumn in my stage of life. Therefore, I have
  </p>
  <p>
   attempted to praise the pomegranate in my verses, which abounds during this season”:
  </p>
  <p>
   The tireless trader rushes to the farthest Indies and prepares to cleave the
  </p>
  <p>
   pearl-bearing92 ocean with his fleet so that, new bride, he can bring you
  </p>
  <p>
   whatever gemstones and dyes the Indians and Tyrians have to offer for
  </p>
  <p>
   your retinue. If these pomegranate seeds, much like brilliant bronze, shine
  </p>
  <p>
   more brightly than purple dye and precious stones, why does he only seek
  </p>
  <p>
   nourishment with his eyes in that place when his mouth can also take a
  </p>
  <p>
   draft of rosy nectar here?
  </p>
  <p>
   Following Sextilius Ligur, a young man (whose name I don’t remember) was
  </p>
  <p>
   commanded to speak. He possessed a particularly wonderful talent for poetry and could
  </p>
  <p>
   produce a hundred lines of poetry while standing on one foot.93 He said: “I do not know
  </p>
  <p>
   whether it is more desirable to excel in intellect or in wealth, especially in the context of
  </p>
  <p>
   these customs, and in this city where rewards, pleasures, honors, and delights accrue
  </p>
  <p>
   only to the wealthy. But I wrote this epigram for a friend of mine, a fortunate and noble
  </p>
  <p>
   man who was complaining about the sluggishness and barrenness of his own talent,
  </p>
  <p>
   especially in regard to composing verses. He said he envied me, on whom nature
  </p>
  <p>
   herself, as they say, had bestowed her aid in writing verses”:
  </p>
  <p>
   91 The work referred to here is Mascardi’s Discorsi morali su la Tavola di Cebete tebano (Venetia: Ad
  </p>
  <p>
   instanza di Girolamo Pelagallo, 1627).

  </p>
  <p>
   You sweat, grow pale, tremble, and gasp your last breath as you write
  </p>
  <p>
   down a few songs, as if Apollo were against you. You fool, why are you
  </p>
  <p>
   rushing toward the infernal shadows now, while Fortune’s pleasing face
  </p>
  <p>
   shines on you? On you she bestowed money and acres of cultivated
  </p>
  <p>
   fields, and on me the ability to produce verses. If you complain that what
  </p>
  <p>
   was given to me is more than my fair share and that my prayers to the
  </p>
  <p>
   gods were granted, ask yourself whether the gods would cause you to
  </p>
  <p>
   enjoy a richer vein if they rescind my gifts, in which you awkwardly tread.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the academy members was a certain Ianus, by the surname Thorius, who
  </p>
  <p>
   was called Offuscatus94 within their group. There was a consensus among everyone
  </p>
  <p>
   that he was the first to be acquainted with ancient coins and inscriptions. And though he
  </p>
  <p>
   yielded to few the highest praise of learning and erudition, he also surpassed everyone
  </p>
  <p>
   in wit and humor. His speech was highly anticipated by all, because he always had
  </p>
  <p>
   something charming and witty to offer. When the Prince of the Academy finally called on
  </p>
  <p>
   him, he said: “In this poem, I lament my friend Caesar’s bad fortune, because, at the
  </p>
  <p>
   age of thirty-two, no hair has yet managed to put down roots on his wrinkly chin”:
  </p>
  <p>
   Caesar had added two years to his six lustra,95 but his face had not yet
  </p>
  <p>
   grown a wispy beard, and he diligently continued to apply medicated
  </p>
  <p>
   ointment to his chin and to exhort the gods with prayers. The compliant
  </p>
  <p>
   gods finally granted his wish and his wrinkled cheeks were stiffened with
  </p>
  <p>
   facial hair. While he rejoiced being able to march with a bearded face, and
  </p>
  <p>
   thought himself handsome because of it, by some stroke of fate, his
  </p>
  <p>
   beard—which had come about through such effort—was not well
  </p>
  <p>
   established, and it fell out. Such is the fickleness of the great gods. They
  </p>
  <p>
   take away such small gifts so quickly!
  </p>
  <p>
   At this point everyone burst into raucous laughter and, at the same time, praised the
  </p>
  <p>
   purity and elegance of his Latin, which that epigram showcased.
  </p>
  <p>
   94 Giovanni Zaratino Castellini (1570-1641) was an antiquarian and epigrapher. A character named
  </p>
  <p>
   Offuscatus also appears in Book Seven, who is identified as Antonio Bosio. According to Tiraboschi
  </p>
  <p>
   (1780: 34) Castellini did recite an oration on the topic of beards at an academy meeting (mentioned by
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi in a 1633 letter to Castellini: “Elegans ille sermo de barbis habitus est a te in Academia
  </p>
  <p>
   Humoristarum, anno [1603]; Ep. ad div. 1.IV.IV). Rossi devotes a portrait to Castellini in his Pinacotheca.

  </p>
  <p>
   By chance, a certain inquisitor named Euganeus96 was present, a man of utmost
  </p>
  <p>
   authority and advanced age, some of whose writings I had seen at Gallonius’s house. I
  </p>
  <p>
   liked them so much that I cannot easily say I had seen anything that better preserved
  </p>
  <p>
   the pure method of writing from the age of Virgil. Everyone was saying that, if there
  </p>
  <p>
   were room in this society for honesty and liberal studies, Euganeus should already have
  </p>
  <p>
   risen to the highest ranks. My ears pricked up with enthusiasm. I was eager for that
  </p>
  <p>
   erudite voice, which was worthy of Roman ears, to delight my own. But it was not to be.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was endowed with such age and such influence that they all treated him as a father,
  </p>
  <p>
   and they thought that he was treating them fairly—indeed excellently—if, every now and
  </p>
  <p>
   then, he was not burdened with attending their academic events and this gathering of
  </p>
  <p>
   learned men.
  </p>
  <p>
   But a noble young man named Tyrrhenus97 satisfied our desire, whose
  </p>
  <p>
   ancestors, very religious and very rich men—who estimated their wealth not by the
  </p>
  <p>
   pound but by the ton—had built the most elegant shrines and magnificent palaces in the
  </p>
  <p>
   city.98 He had devoted his most excellent mind to that loftiest of subjects, the civil law,
  </p>
  <p>
   and had placed himself under the direction a very learned lawyer. He is so devoted to
  </p>
  <p>
   the skill and practice of the liberal arts, that, even when he had free time, especially
  </p>
  <p>
   when court was not in session, he still composed verses that are endowed with the kind
  </p>
  <p>
   96 Antonio Querenghi (1546-1633), a neo-Latin poet. Rossi devotes a portrait to Querenghi in his
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinacotheca. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 12.
  </p>
  <p>
   97 Fabio Chigi (1599-1667) was a lauded humanist and neo-Latin poet, member of the Accademia degli
  </p>
  <p>
   Umoristi, and a frequent correspondent of Rossi. He was elected Pope in 1655 taking the name
  </p>
  <p>
   Alexander VII. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 13.
  </p>
  <p>
   98 According to IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 15) this is a reference to the wealthy Sienese banker and
  </p>
  <p>
   patron Agostino Chigi (1466-1520), whose commissions included a chapel in Santa Maria della Pace, the
  </p>
  <p>
   Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo, and Villa Farnesina in Trastevere.
  </p>
  <p>
   349
  </p>
  <p>
   of purity and elegance of language as to garner admiration. He sprinkles them with a
  </p>
  <p>
   patina of urbanity that gives Romans the impression, or persuades them, that they
  </p>
  <p>
   share a native soil. Asked if he would speak, he recited this epigram about Cupid and
  </p>
  <p>
   Apollo sleeping beneath an oak tree:
  </p>
  <p>
   While sleep flitted about Phoebus on gentle wing and the shady oak cast a
  </p>
  <p>
   shadow over him with its branches, swift Cupid saw him from a nearby
  </p>
  <p>
   rock; ordering his quick feet to move more slowly, he said: “I see the sun
  </p>
  <p>
   sleeping in the shade, and the light which brings the day is hidden by the
  </p>
  <p>
   night.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Associated with that gathering of learned men were a few who were passed over
  </p>
  <p>
   freely, and from whom no recitation was expected. When we asked the reason for this,
  </p>
  <p>
   someone responded that they were from the old academy where there were no rules
  </p>
  <p>
   obligating them to recite. When we insisted on asking Gallonius what kind of men the
  </p>
  <p>
   old academy was made up of, he said: “The best and most agreeable kind. As for the
  </p>
  <p>
   rest, this academy, which rose out of small beginnings, has grown to this large size,
  </p>
  <p>
   which you now see. Indeed, in the beginning only a few young men used to gather in
  </p>
  <p>
   this house, on the festival of Dionysus, to pursue entertainment and pleasure by putting
  </p>
  <p>
   on comic plays. These are the people who sit silently among the others. But their
  </p>
  <p>
   custom did not die out, and it lives on even now. According to their laws, no one is
  </p>
  <p>
   admitted into these comedic pursuits except by a vote, and if someone is even one vote
  </p>
  <p>
   short, whether he is a dynast or the king himself, he is excluded and rejected. Noble
  </p>
  <p>
   wives are permitted to attend academy meetings along with their husbands, for it is not
  </p>
  <p>
   considered unseemly or indecent to make noblewomen laugh, as long as they are
  </p>
  <p>
   outstanding both in age and beauty.”99
  </p>
  <p>
   99 Francis W. Gravit (1935: 507) takes this passage as evidence that wives of academy members were
  </p>
  <p>
   allowed to attend meetings. Frederick F. Hammond (1994: 86) asserts that the virtuosa musician and
  </p>
  <p>
   350
  </p>
  <p>
   There was a man among them named Iberus who had an honest face, gray hair,
  </p>
  <p>
   and a robe that went down to his ankles. Although he had been passed over according
  </p>
  <p>
   to custom, he rose and said: “I do not want it to seem like I’m getting off easy by only
  </p>
  <p>
   performing comic plays. I also desire to prove my dedication to composing verses with
  </p>
  <p>
   this epigram, and to show you how I keep my health up through the summer months.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Everyone pricked up their ears to listen, and he began:
  </p>
  <p>
   To stay healthy all summer, and for Leo’s furious star not to harm you,
  </p>
  <p>
   always wet your lips with dark, chilled wine, and lay your body down in a
  </p>
  <p>
   dry place.
  </p>
  <p>
   He moved us to laughter and, at the same time, this charming man’s character received
  </p>
  <p>
   unanimous praise. We heard the following about him, that there was nobody in that
  </p>
  <p>
   most respected troupe of actors who could play the braggart soldier100 more realistically
  </p>
  <p>
   than he. He was beloved by everyone on account of his pleasantness, and he was the
  </p>
  <p>
   guest of honor at the gatherings, banquets, and drinking parties of his friends.
  </p>
  <p>
   Micrus of Pesaro,101 who was always the last to be called on, had still not
  </p>
  <p>
   spoken. There was nobody better than he in terms of his voice or his quickness of wit;
  </p>
  <p>
   nobody sharper in challenging others or in responding to challenges; nobody more
  </p>
  <p>
   polished, in any speaking style, in terms of his wit and humor. He had a writing style that
  </p>
  <p>
   was magnificent, clear, delightful, and comprised splendid and acute phrases. When
  </p>
  <p>
   Micrus came prepared to speak, he did not tolerate getting caught up in the pettiness of
  </p>
  <p>
   performer Leonora Baroni was a full-fledged member of the Umoristi, which would have made her the
  </p>
  <p>
   only female one (women were not permitted to be regular members). I am not convinced that this
  </p>
  <p>
   passage is sufficient evidence for such an assertion. Whether or not Baroni was a member, however, she
  </p>
  <p>
   and other virtuose (courtesans) did attend meetings where they performed music, often singing, and
  </p>
  <p>
   contributed poetry and plays (see Chapter 3, n. 152).

  <p>
   those who spent the day protesting or making excuses, when they themselves preferred
  </p>
  <p>
   speaking much more than others preferred listening. He recited these words with
  </p>
  <p>
   outspoken and frank confidence:
  </p>
  <p>
   While pious Aeneas burned with the fire of love that he was imbibing from
  </p>
  <p>
   your eyes, sweet Elissa,102 he exclaimed: “Did the fires of Troy let me go
  </p>
  <p>
   unharmed so that lofty Carthage might burn with new pyres? Alas, I will
  </p>
  <p>
   die your unequal! Before, death could have brought me fame; now, life
  </p>
  <p>
   and honor are dead to me.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I was thinking about reciting another poem for you in which I present as a speaker the
  </p>
  <p>
   recently deceased wife of Philippus, the leader of our troops. Rather than burden you
  </p>
  <p>
   with more verses, however, I think I will concede that you have heard enough. For this
  </p>
  <p>
   reason, I will refrain for the moment and put off that poem for another speaking
  </p>
  <p>
   occasion.” But everyone said they wanted to hear it right then and there, and so he
  </p>
  <p>
   recited with his usual enthusiasm:
  </p>
  <p>
   This gravestone is sprinkled with tears and with songs, so that my fame
  </p>
  <p>
   will be celebrated throughout all eternity. These pious gifts are indeed
  </p>
  <p>
   pleasing to our ashes. What is more pleasing, however, and the highest
  </p>
  <p>
   honor, is that I was joined to you, my husband Philip, and was dearer to
  </p>
  <p>
   you than your very eyes and your own life. This will grant that my long life
  </p>
  <p>
   is secured. You alone are the steady pillar of my renown. Other women do
  </p>
  <p>
   not have poems dedicated to them, whereas I have them in abundance,
  </p>
  <p>
   because they will say that I was married to such a man.
  </p>
  <p>
   The silence that greeted the poem, along with everyone’s approbation, showed that it
  </p>
  <p>
   had pleased them exceedingly.
  </p>
  <p>
   When it seemed that there was no longer anyone left to take a turn speaking,
  </p>
  <p>
   everybody got up to leave. Hiero Volusius, the one who had so eloquently praised the
  </p>
  <p>
   gnat, called for silence by raising his hand and saying: “I do not want to seem like I have
  </p>
  <p>
   102 Elissa, or Elisa: an alternative name for Dido.
  </p>
  <p>
   352
  </p>
  <p>
   gotten away without contributing anything to this venue, or rather, to this veritable
  </p>
  <p>
   convivium of writers, where offerings have been collected from so many literary men, as
  </p>
  <p>
   if from guests at a banquet. For this reason I will also contribute something to the mix
  </p>
  <p>
   and recite the poem, in iambic meter, with which I mourned the untimely death of
  </p>
  <p>
   Ursatus, the recently deceased defender of virtue and honor. As you know, he was the
  </p>
  <p>
   very model of integrity and of every virtue”:
  </p>
  <p>
   The unrighteous mind of mortals always rushes headlong into wickedness.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decrees of menacing laws do not hold someone back if he is bent on
  </p>
  <p>
   committing a crime, and the fierce hands of lictors do not restrain him with
  </p>
  <p>
   any authority. Nor do the rewards, allotted to the righteous, compel him
  </p>
  <p>
   toward shining virtue. Thus, we detest things that are right. What praise
  </p>
  <p>
   and great glory awaits you for all time, Ursatus, whom neither the vigorous
  </p>
  <p>
   and flourishing ornament of age, nor the bright glow of power, has diverted
  </p>
  <p>
   from the narrow path of virtue and drawn into slothful leisure! We are
  </p>
  <p>
   amazed that the dark day has carried you off and overwhelmed you with a
  </p>
  <p>
   quick death. An extraordinary event does not grant a long showing but
  </p>
  <p>
   ceases within a brief period of time. You, like a miracle, not having
  </p>
  <p>
   reached a fitting age for death, have taken flight prematurely toward the
  </p>
  <p>
   stars.
  </p>
  <p>
   When he had finished speaking, the evening was suddenly at an end. Once we were
  </p>
  <p>
   granted permission to take our leave, we stood up and exited with the rest of the crowd
  </p>
  <p>
   leaving behind a group of academy members that was making its way over to Hiero to
  </p>
  <p>
   congratulate him on his learned poem in praise of the gnat.
  </p>
  <p>
   When we had crossed the threshold of our house, we caught sight of a long
  </p>
  <p>
   procession of adolescent boys walking in pairs, barefoot, and with their eyes cast down
  </p>
  <p>
   on the ground. They were singing a song, with which I was not familiar, in a doleful and
  </p>
  <p>
   low voice. An equally large group of girls was following them and singing in almost the
  </p>
  <p>
   353
  </p>
  <p>
   same manner. While we were looking on in wonder, Gallonius said: “Alexander,103 priest
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Temple of Daphne and Apollo and a most renowned dynast, has been bedridden
  </p>
  <p>
   for six days now consumed by a serious and dangerous illness. As I heard tell, a few
  </p>
  <p>
   hours ago, while you were attentively taking in the recitations of the academy, his illness
  </p>
  <p>
   worsened so much that the doctors almost gave up hope. But these boys and girls,
  </p>
  <p>
   supported by his charity, have been praying at all of the temples dedicated to
  </p>
  <p>
   Aesculapius and asking for his favor. This city would certainly sustain an enormous loss
  </p>
  <p>
   with his untimely death, since there is nobody who comes close to him in terms of
  </p>
  <p>
   financial outlay, and who goes further than he in terms of expense and splendor.” When
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius was finished, and since it was almost evening, we gradually and quietly made
  </p>
  <p>
   our way home. When we got there, we gave ourselves over first to dinner and then to
  </p>
  <p>
   bed.
  </p>
  <p>
   We awoke at the second watch104 startled by mournful and plaintive voices that
  </p>
  <p>
   were filling the entire neighborhood. Terrified, we got up, stuck our heads out the
  </p>
  <p>
   window, and discovered that the wailing was coming from the hospital next door to
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius’s palace. We were only able to make out these cries: “Woe is me! Woe is me!
  </p>
  <p>
   I am in agony! My stomach is exploding! My spleen, my liver, my intestines are all
  </p>
  <p>
   rioting and preparing an assault!” That particular hospital was the largest and by far the
  </p>
  <p>
   103 Cardinal Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto. He also appears under the name Plusius. He was
  </p>
  <p>
   famous for his patronage of the arts as well as for being a collector of art.
  </p>
  <p>
   104 A Roman day was divided into twelve equal daytime hours (sunrise to sunset) and twelve equal
  </p>
  <p>
   nighttime hours (sunset to sunrise). The length of each individual hour was not fixed but would vary
  </p>
  <p>
   according to the seasons (i.e., according to the length of days and nights). The nighttime hours were
  </p>
  <p>
   divided into four periods of three hours each, called vigiliae, which originated as a military term signifying
  </p>
  <p>
   a shift of the night watch. The second watch occurred between 9:00 p.m. and midnight.
  </p>
  <p>
   354
  </p>
  <p>
   most famous of all of the hospitals in the city,105 and it maintained a large number of
  </p>
  <p>
   employees in order to attend to patients. The staff was managed by a certain old man,
  </p>
  <p>
   with the authority and title of Chief of Staff, who was said to be extremely stingy and
  </p>
  <p>
   severe and who strove for nothing so much as to keep costs down. He employed
  </p>
  <p>
   neither good judgment nor moderation in this endeavor, and he occasionally lost large
  </p>
  <p>
   sums of money in order to gain a single mina of profit. Gallonius, who was either seized
  </p>
  <p>
   by pity for the afflicted employees, or eager to understand the suffering of the human
  </p>
  <p>
   race, said: “What do you say we go and give the staff and patients a hand?” “Agreed,”
  </p>
  <p>
   responded Aemilius, and we all donned our swords and hurried together to help those
  </p>
  <p>
   poor people.
  </p>
  <p>
   We entered the hospital and crept through the entire place—the cafeteria, the
  </p>
  <p>
   pantry, the spice cabinet (where didn’t we go?)—but we didn’t bump into a single
  </p>
  <p>
   person. In the infirmary, we found a doctor applying bronze cupping glasses to a patient
  </p>
  <p>
   and drawing blood from his skin with a blade. Since we never came across anyone, we
  </p>
  <p>
   ended up following the sounds of groaning voices. We entered a bathroom, and there
  </p>
  <p>
   we found the entire staff huddled together driven there by a gastric emergency. There
  </p>
  <p>
   were more than fifteen toilets in the bathroom, and each one was occupied by people
  </p>
  <p>
   evacuating their bowels. The last ones to run to the bathroom were asking the first ones
  </p>
  <p>
   to get up and give them their spot. Others, who were more prone to anger, were
  </p>
  <p>
   threatening to evacuate their bowels on the laps of those who were already sitting on
  </p>
  <p>
   the toilet. Others resorted to violence and struggled to shove the ones occupying the
  </p>
  <p>
   105 This is a reference to the Ospedale di Santo Spirito an ancient hospital (now a convention center)
  </p>
  <p>
   located in the rione Borgo in Rome, east of Vatican City.
  </p>
  <p>
   355
  </p>
  <p>
   toilets out of the way. Everyone was filling the place simultaneously with a foul sound
  </p>
  <p>
   and stench.
  </p>
  <p>
   We asked one man, who had gotten off the toilet, how it had come to pass that
  </p>
  <p>
   everybody was emptying their loose bowels at exactly the same time. He said he
  </p>
  <p>
   blamed it on the wine they had consumed at dinner the previous evening. In fact,
  </p>
  <p>
   because that cheap, tight-fisted hospital chief didn’t want the large quantity of dregs
  </p>
  <p>
   collected from his many wine casks to be thrown out, he consulted with the wine
  </p>
  <p>
   steward as to how he could foist them on those who were drinking. The wine steward, in
  </p>
  <p>
   order to enter into the chief’s good graces, said: “I will concoct a wine for you out of
  </p>
  <p>
   these dregs that is so pure, so unadulterated, so pungent and smooth at the same time,
  </p>
  <p>
   that whoever tastes it will not only not be put off, but will gulp it down eagerly.” In sum,
  </p>
  <p>
   the steward diluted the carefully collected dregs with a lot of flat wine and, after adding
  </p>
  <p>
   egg-yolks, sulfur, and especially a large quantity of alum, he strained the whole batch
  </p>
  <p>
   and served it up to be consumed in place of the wine. Barely had four hours gone by
  </p>
  <p>
   after that drinking binge, when everyone’s bowels began to overflow and be torn up by
  </p>
  <p>
   the sharpest pains you could possibly imagine. Upon hearing this, we burst out laughing
  </p>
  <p>
   at him so completely that we almost busted a gut. But Gallonius told him to cheer up, for
  </p>
  <p>
   he hoped that this wine would serve in place of the medicinal syrups that keep those
  </p>
  <p>
   lethal illnesses at bay, which the arrival of the unhealthy season had brought in.106 We
  </p>
  <p>
   departed immediately, returned to our beds, and went back to sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
   106 The “unhealthy season” is summer, during which season epidemics of malaria would break out (see
  </p>
  <p>
   Chapter 3, n. 26).

  </p>
  <p>
   The following day we got up much earlier than we had the day before so we
  </p>
  <p>
   could visit the rest of the neighborhoods in the city. However, the news had become
  </p>
  <p>
   public that Dynast Alexander had died that night. There was sorrow and mourning all
  </p>
  <p>
   around, and people of every age and rank were flocking to his palace to see him. As
  </p>
  <p>
   one dynast was arriving and another was leaving, the two bumped into each other,
  </p>
  <p>
   whereupon they stopped and greeted each other in the friendliest manner. Each
  </p>
  <p>
   solemnly declared to the other that no one was more pleasing or dearer to him than he,
  </p>
  <p>
   and each then pledged to the other his unqualified devotion and service, be it labor,
  </p>
  <p>
   effort, or time. Each added, moreover, that no request was so arduous or so difficult that
  </p>
  <p>
   he would not easily and cheerfully take it up on the other’s behalf. At this point,
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius let out a loud guffaw. Astonished, I asked him why he was laughing, to which
  </p>
  <p>
   he replied: “I am laughing because it is not easy to find two men who are so divided by
  </p>
  <p>
   hatred from one another as these two are. See how these wicked men are dissembling,
  </p>
  <p>
   embracing each other, and pledging their mutual aid? In Rome people behave
  </p>
  <p>
   differently. There hostilities are declared publicly and are out in the open, rather than
  </p>
  <p>
   kept secret and hidden. Here everyone puts on a friendly face, but many harbor an
  </p>
  <p>
   angry spirit. Anger is concealed, while flattery is on full display.”
  </p>
  <p>
   He would have said more about the character of those two men if a great cry had
  </p>
  <p>
   not interrupted him. This caused us to turn around and see a large crowd of children
  </p>
  <p>
   and other people whistling and crying as they followed one lone man, who was pale,
  </p>
  <p>
   filthy, and looked like he had just returned from the dead. “Hey, what did you do among
  </p>
  <p>
   the dead?” one person called out. “Do they have taverns and innkeepers there? Do
  </p>
  <p>
   357
  </p>
  <p>
   people eat and drink?” Another shouted: “Why didn’t Orcus107 want to keep you? He
  </p>
  <p>
   maybe could have used someone to strike fear into children who refuse to go to school!
  </p>
  <p>
   I ask you, did Pluto provide you proof that you were dead?”108 Others chimed in: “If only
  </p>
  <p>
   a similar right of return could be granted to Dynast Alexander whom Pluto has just taken
  </p>
  <p>
   from us. But that is something we can only wish for, rather than something we hope
  </p>
  <p>
   could actually come true. What an evil deed! This man here, who deserved to be among
  </p>
  <p>
   the shades, has been summoned back to the light, while that man, who was the
  </p>
  <p>
   brightest light of his country on account of the superlative splendor of his life, has been
  </p>
  <p>
   deprived of life.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Ignorant of the whole matter, we asked what the story was. There was one man
  </p>
  <p>
   among them who appeared to be the sharpest at weaving a tale. This man replied:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Listen to this ridiculous story. This man, who was carried out of his house with a large
  </p>
  <p>
   retinue, was thought to be dead and was placed in a tomb while still alive, and he lay
  </p>
  <p>
   there for three days without any food.” We were horrified when we heard this and
  </p>
  <p>
   burned with an even greater desire to hear the story. The man satisfied our desire. “But
  </p>
  <p>
   before I get to it,” he said, “I need to tell you what sort of a man he is. There is nobody
  </p>
  <p>
   more ferocious, more full of disgrace than this man here, who now appears before you
  </p>
  <p>
   as calm, despondent, and quiet—though old age has diminished his usual
  </p>
  <p>
   aggressiveness and wild behavior quite a bit. Before this he was, more than can be
  </p>
  <p>
   expressed in words, bad-tempered, angry, drunk, arrogant, gluttonous, spoiling for a
  </p>
  <p>
   fight with both his hands and his tongue; a master of nighttime orgies, and a leader and
  </p>
  <p>
   107 In Roman religion Orcus is a synonym of Dis (or Dis Pater), the god of the Underworld, or the
  </p>
  <p>
   Underworld itself. Pluto (below) is another name for Dis.

  </p>
  <p>
   commander of others in killing and beating up men. He had an almost singular talent for
  </p>
  <p>
   whipping up a crowd and inciting riots, and he was far superior to anyone else in hurling
  </p>
  <p>
   frightful curses—for no reason—against the immortal gods.
  </p>
  <p>
   “If it is permitted to judge the nature of a man especially from his actions,
  </p>
  <p>
   consider what rank and position he should hold based on this one outrage: When he
  </p>
  <p>
   arrived as a young man among the porridge eaters109 (foreigners whose customs are far
  </p>
  <p>
   removed from ours), he was seized in one of their districts and questioned as to his
  </p>
  <p>
   identity. He replied: ‘Scoundrels, parasites, thieves! May the evil that the gods bring
  </p>
  <p>
   down on you be great and swift! What business is that of yours? Go to hell!’ Even
  </p>
  <p>
   though the barbarians didn’t understand what he was saying, they guessed, from his
  </p>
  <p>
   facial expressions and his intent look—and from the force with which he was trying to
  </p>
  <p>
   free himself from their chains—that he was cursing them, and they unanimously
  </p>
  <p>
   decided to cut off his head with a single blow. But behold the fearless spirit of this man.
  </p>
  <p>
   While he was dodging their spears and being carried off to his death, just as the sword
  </p>
  <p>
   was hanging above his neck, and just as he sensed he was about to be harmed, he
  </p>
  <p>
   yelled: ‘Come on you filthy thieves and murderers! I will get my revenge on you good
  </p>
  <p>
   and proper, if I live!’ But when the barbarian, who had taken it upon himself to lop the
  </p>
  <p>
   man’s head off with a single blow of his ax, was not able to complete what he had
  </p>
  <p>
   attempted, he left the man gravely wounded in the neck and abandoned on the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
   109 The Latin is pultiphagos, which is a comic designation, found in Plautus, for early Romans who ate
  </p>
  <p>
   mush or a type of spelt porridge (puls) instead of bread (see Plaut. Mostell. III.ii.828: “non enim haec
  </p>
  <p>
   pultiphagus opifex opera fecit barbarous”; and Plaut. Poen. Prologue l. 54: “latine Plautus patruos
  </p>
  <p>
   pultiphagonides”). Drujon (1966: 1055) supposes that the word in this text designates either Swiss or
  </p>
  <p>
   German people, and IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 18) surmises that it refers to Germans. These are
  </p>
  <p>
   convincing suppositions, since the man in the story is seized in a pagus, a term employed by Caesar,
  </p>
  <p>
   Tacitus, and Ammianus to refer to the districs and cantons of the Gauls and Germans (e.g., Caes. BGall.
  </p>
  <p>
   VI.11, I.12, IV.1, VI.23, VII.64; Tac. G. 39; Amm. 18.2.1).
  </p>
  <p>
   359
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of his very robust health, the man healed from his wound in no time. Furious
  </p>
  <p>
   that he had suffered such a grave injury, the man carefully considered how he could
  </p>
  <p>
   return the favor and repay those wicked men, set his mind on various plans, and could
  </p>
  <p>
   not get a moment’s rest. When all of his plans were nicely drawn up in his mind, he
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly pulled up stakes and made his way over to his enemies. Learn the method of
  </p>
  <p>
   the punishment and, at the same time, admire how much audacity can exist in a single
  </p>
  <p>
   individual. In the dead of night, he took advantage of the wind that was blowing, and,
  </p>
  <p>
   setting fire to a few huts, he burned down almost the entire village before any of his
  </p>
  <p>
   enemies noticed or could pull themselves together.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The man, however, hidden with the aid of night, reached our city unharmed. He
  </p>
  <p>
   was taken in by Dynast Palladius as one of his servants and, after that, into the service
  </p>
  <p>
   of many other dynasts. However, this fickle and capricious man finally grew tired of life
  </p>
  <p>
   at court and he set his mind to getting a wife. To make a long story short, he married a
  </p>
  <p>
   young girl and then hired out his services to the Vestal Virgins. You are acquainted with
  </p>
  <p>
   a woman’s character: fickle, hard to please, superstitious, and difficult. Those good
  </p>
  <p>
   Vestal Virgins worked him so hard that they did not allow him any time off. There was
  </p>
  <p>
   not a day during the winter months, even during a huge or violent storm, that they did
  </p>
  <p>
   not force him to walk—twice—to the Placidiani gardens, which were located four miles
  </p>
  <p>
   outside of the city at the estate of the dynast who owned them.110 Wherefore, from the
  </p>
  <p>
   110 Placidiani Gardens possibly refers to Villa Peretti-Montalto and its famous gardens (see Chapter 3, n.
  </p>
  <p>
   18). Given that the locus of action of Eudemia is the Vatican and the court of Urban VIII, the distance from
  </p>
  <p>
   Vatican City to Villa Peretti-Montalto more or less matches the four-mile distance given here (I thank
  </p>
  <p>
   Laura Foster of John Cabot University for suggesting this identification). The description of a hardworking
  </p>
  <p>
   servant forced to walk back and forth through inclement weather is reminiscent of the story of the long-
  </p>
  <p>
   suffering Nicius Rufus in Book Five, which is a clear reference to Rossi’s own days in the employ of
  </p>
  <p>
   Cardinal Peretti di Montalto.
  </p>
  <p>
   360
  </p>
  <p>
   cold and exertion, he contracted an illness that lasted many months. In the end, it was
  </p>
  <p>
   determined, in his doctors’ opinion, that he should abandon all hope of ever getting well.
  </p>
  <p>
   The man laughed, called the doctors mad, and declared that he would outlive both them
  </p>
  <p>
   and their children.
  </p>
  <p>
   “While he was defying the doctors’ prognoses, he appeared to lose
  </p>
  <p>
   consciousness. His breath was impeded and flowed with such difficulty that he lost all
  </p>
  <p>
   his senses. He displayed all the customary signs of a dead man: a pale complexion,
  </p>
  <p>
   stiffness throughout his whole body, and a complete loss of sensation. His wife
  </p>
  <p>
   prepared a funeral for the supposedly dead man, and she couldn’t get his corpse out of
  </p>
  <p>
   her house fast enough. Because of his uncontrollable temper, her husband often spoke
  </p>
  <p>
   rudely to her and even beat her badly. Nevertheless, so as not to incur gossip and
  </p>
  <p>
   rebuke from the public she performed the final rites for the man she believed to be
  </p>
  <p>
   dead, not only with her tears but also with as much expense as she, a poor woman,
  </p>
  <p>
   could manage. After the undertakers had been summoned, the dead man was carried
  </p>
  <p>
   away, placed in a tomb, and the entrance to the tomb was sealed. After only one day
  </p>
  <p>
   had passed after his burial, his breathing, which had stopped, returned to its life-giving
  </p>
  <p>
   role, and he woke up believing he had been sleeping next to his wife for no longer than
  </p>
  <p>
   a single night. He raised his head up a little, and he perceived a sort of thin ray of light
  </p>
  <p>
   coming from the entrance to the tomb, which had not been properly sealed. Gently
  </p>
  <p>
   nudging the corpse of some woman who had recently been placed there, he said: ‘Hey
  </p>
  <p>
   Milphidippa!’111 (that was his wife’s name), ‘get up and open the window!’ Milphidippa
  </p>
  <p>
   did not respond. Again, he said: ‘Hey, are you planning to wake up any time today? I’m
  </p>
  <p>
   111 Name of a maidservant in Plaut. Mil.
  </p>
  <p>
   361
  </p>
  <p>
   already late in taking the medicine my doctor prescribed.’ His words fell on deaf ears.
  </p>
  <p>
   Annoyed, he said: ‘What is this? Am I speaking to the dead? Look at this woman!
  </p>
  <p>
   Before, when I was well, she always got up before sunrise and shook me out of my
  </p>
  <p>
   sleep. Now, when I don’t need to sleep, she is thoroughly in the grip of it herself.’ Since
  </p>
  <p>
   his bed seemed firmer than usual, he tried lying on his other side, where he bumped up
  </p>
  <p>
   against the cadaver of another dead man. Suspecting that it was some lover or other of
  </p>
  <p>
   his wife, he exclaimed: ‘What a shameful outrage! That most wicked woman has
  </p>
  <p>
   brought her lover right under my nose—and even into the same bed! What would she
  </p>
  <p>
   do if I were dead, buried, and in my grave? And to mock me even more shamelessly,
  </p>
  <p>
   she is pretending to be asleep!’ Swollen with rage, he said: ‘We’ll see soon enough if
  </p>
  <p>
   I’m not able to wake you up!’ He grabbed one of her legs and began nudging her back
  </p>
  <p>
   and forth. Barely had he touched the dead woman’s leg with his hands, when it tore off
  </p>
  <p>
   and came away from the rest of her corpse. When that happened, he was hit by the
  </p>
  <p>
   foulness of a repulsive stench and it was clear he was extremely terrified. He then
  </p>
  <p>
   carefully felt around with his hands to see what else was around him, touching only
  </p>
  <p>
   pieces of wood and the bones of dead people, until he finally realized whose lands he
  </p>
  <p>
   had come to rest in. He cried: ‘Alas, I’ve been buried alive! Somebody open up this
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb immediately!’
  </p>
  <p>
   But the poor man spoke these words in vain to the senseless air, which
  </p>
  <p>
   was unable to hear or utter any sounds in reply.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Either some god was looking out for him, or fate came to his aid, but within a few
  </p>
  <p>
   days of this happening, a certain porter died and was carried into the same tomb. When
  </p>
  <p>
   the pallbearers opened the entrance, the man inside began shouting: ‘Bring me some
  </p>
  <p>
   lunch—it’s now been three days that I’ve been in here without any food!’ The
  </p>
  <p>
   362
  </p>
  <p>
   pallbearers, undertakers, and morticians, terrified by his voice, dropped their candles,
  </p>
  <p>
   abandoned the corpse, and ran away as quickly as possible. The man didn’t stop, but
  </p>
  <p>
   he yelled even louder for someone to get him out of there, saying ‘Where the hell am I?’
  </p>
  <p>
   What kind of men, what kind people are so barbaric as to do this? Are the
  </p>
  <p>
   living to be kept from the gift of light?
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps that poor porter had drunk a bit too eagerly to his own health at the tavern and,
  </p>
  <p>
   because of that, he had fallen asleep—and before he had slept off his hangover, he was
  </p>
  <p>
   carried into this tomb, as if dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Once the other men had recovered a bit from their fear, they returned and spoke
  </p>
  <p>
   with him, as if they were talking to portents and omens from hell. To which he
  </p>
  <p>
   responded: ‘You must be joking. I am alive—and I’m hungry!’ He narrated the rest of the
  </p>
  <p>
   story in the order it happened. Believing the man, they got him out of the tomb, gave
  </p>
  <p>
   him food and drink, and brought him home to his wife. It was not certain whether she
  </p>
  <p>
   would be struck more by surprise or resentment. Thinking that her husband had gone to
  </p>
  <p>
   a place from which no one is permitted to return, she had identified, on her own, another
  </p>
  <p>
   man to be her husband.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Here was an opening to interrupt our storyteller. “How his wife must have wished
  </p>
  <p>
   that funerals for the dead were carried out here the same way they are in Rome where
  </p>
  <p>
   bodies are thrown on a burning pyre! By god, she wouldn’t now be witnessing the return
  </p>
  <p>
   of her husband after his funeral.” He replied: “If we had that custom here, I reckon she
  </p>
  <p>
   would have lit the pyre herself and carried her husband onto the flames with her own
  </p>
  <p>
   bare hands. Then, in order to be entirely free from fear, she would have gathered his
  </p>
  <p>
   ashes and tossed them into some river or other. Such is her hatred of her husband that
  </p>
  <p>
   I believe she is tormenting herself, saying she is unattractive and lamenting that she
  </p>
  <p>
   363
  </p>
  <p>
   was born for the sole purpose of putting up with suffering.” To which I replied: “If the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead came back to life here, everyone would prefer to live here as a pauper than have a
  </p>
  <p>
   kingdom elsewhere. Indeed, as far as I am concerned, I would not want to live out my
  </p>
  <p>
   life anywhere else.” He said that coming back to life is only granted to those who have
  </p>
  <p>
   not yet crossed the Cocytus, and that those who reach the far shore of that river are
  </p>
  <p>
   made to lose all memory of this life, along with their hope of ever returning to it. When
  </p>
  <p>
   we had finished, we dismissed him with a laugh and proceeded to tour the rest of the
  </p>
  <p>
   city.
  </p>
  <p>
   At last, we returned home because we were tired of walking and because the
  </p>
  <p>
   hottest period of the day had begun. We had some free time and nothing to do. It wasn’t
  </p>
  <p>
   lunchtime yet, and Gallonius was not allowed to sit at the table before his dynast had
  </p>
  <p>
   finished his own lunch and the tables had been cleared. We reckoned that the morning
  </p>
  <p>
   hours would be less tedious if we could spend them with Gallonius in his dynast’s
  </p>
  <p>
   house, where many things would be readily available for us to see and hear and to
  </p>
  <p>
   entertain us with delight. We headed over there, entered the anteroom, and withdrew by
  </p>
  <p>
   ourselves into a corner. The good servants, as they are wont to do to pass the time,
  </p>
  <p>
   unsheathed their tongues like swords in order to destroy everyone’s good name. First
  </p>
  <p>
   they began to slander the reputation of a certain well-known woman, then they
  </p>
  <p>
   undertook to strip another man, one of admirable virtue, of his long-standing reputation
  </p>
  <p>
   for honesty and loyalty. One of the servants recounted, from memory, the names of all
  </p>
  <p>
   of the city’s prostitutes. Because of their number, which was beyond count, and
  </p>
  <p>
   because of the power of his memory, which was unbelievable, he seemed like Cyrus
  </p>
  <p>
   who, while reviewing his army, could call on each soldier by name. Another servant was
  </p>
  <p>
   364
  </p>
  <p>
   savaging the gauche host with curses because he was serving starling instead of thrush
  </p>
  <p>
   for lunch and beef instead of veal. When there was nobody left to insult, and when they
  </p>
  <p>
   had grown tired of cursing, they began talking about Dynast Alexander. They confirmed,
  </p>
  <p>
   based on the opinion of all the doctors, that he had died prematurely, especially since
  </p>
  <p>
   he was not very old and, moreover, since he enjoyed robust physical strength. Next,
  </p>
  <p>
   they asked which man, from among those who were holding out so much hope, would
  </p>
  <p>
   succeed Alexander as King in that most distinguished office which he had just held.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each one of them favored a certain person over another, according to the enthusiasm
  </p>
  <p>
   that each candidate excited in him, either out of friendship, or hope for some sort of
  </p>
  <p>
   favor.
  </p>
  <p>
   While they were chatting, a man appeared in the antechamber. His face was
  </p>
  <p>
   honest but his eyes were cast downward on the ground. All of the servants immediately
  </p>
  <p>
   approached him, walked around him, stood around him in a circle, and congratulated
  </p>
  <p>
   him on some honor he had recently received. One of them, more than the others,
  </p>
  <p>
   seemed almost to melt and flow away out of love and goodwill toward the man, so much
  </p>
  <p>
   so that he took turns crying and hesitating, as if he did not possess a vocabulary
  </p>
  <p>
   sufficient for declaring the magnitude of his love. Gallonius was amazed and was stifling
  </p>
  <p>
   his laughter with a handkerchief. He finally came over to us and said: “I can’t tell you
  </p>
  <p>
   how much these people are making me laugh. You see that man receiving all of those
  </p>
  <p>
   congratulations? A few days ago, he was very powerful, thanks to his authority and
  </p>
  <p>
   influence with our dynast, that all of the affairs in our household were administered
  </p>
  <p>
   according to his counsel and judgment. This aroused a great deal of jealously and led
  </p>
  <p>
   many people to plot against him. Noticing this, he reckoned that he would do better to
  </p>
  <p>
   365
  </p>
  <p>
   leave of his own accord than be removed in disgrace. In order to make it seem like he
  </p>
  <p>
   had changed jobs rather than quit, he asked the dynast, out of favor and goodwill, for
  </p>
  <p>
   another position that seemed, at least in appearance, to be distinguished and noble but
  </p>
  <p>
   was, in fact, utterly trifling and trivial. So that poor man has come to the dynast to thank
  </p>
  <p>
   him. But the man who especially makes me laugh is that one there, who is hiding his
  </p>
  <p>
   hatred so skillfully behind a pretense of goodwill. There is no more dangerous or hostile
  </p>
  <p>
   an enemy than he to that other man who gave up his position. Our dynast has been
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly taken in by his efforts and misled by the jealousy and attacks on that man’s
  </p>
  <p>
   privilege and renown. I ask you to observe how that evil man dissembles, how he
  </p>
  <p>
   deceitfully flatters and artfully slanders him!”
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, someone rushed into our midst and said: “I have in my room a
  </p>
  <p>
   jug of excellent and very cold wine. I’d say that I have not tasted any more pleasant a
  </p>
  <p>
   wine this summer than this one. It is the king of wines, the darling of Bacchus—it will
  </p>
  <p>
   tickle and soothe your tongue at the same time.” “Perfect timing,” said another,
  </p>
  <p>
   “because, you see, I haven’t drunk any wine since I got up this morning—and you see
  </p>
  <p>
   what time of day it is!” Another man added: “My parched throat is also burning with
  </p>
  <p>
   thirst. If I don’t water it quickly, it will turn to dust.” Grabbing Gallonius by the right hand,
  </p>
  <p>
   he said: “Let’s go quench our thirst—I see you are also dying of it. At the same time, we
  </p>
  <p>
   can find out whether what he is saying is true.” Gallonius complied and followed him,
  </p>
  <p>
   and we tagged along. Everyone rushed into the man’s room, attacked the wine jug, and
  </p>
  <p>
   blotted out their minds with barely one draft. There was a pot placed next to the fire, full
  </p>
  <p>
   of lamb that had not yet finished cooking. One of the men snatched the meat away and
  </p>
  <p>
   out of the room, put it on a plate, and, while it was still hot, put it in his belly. Another
  </p>
  <p>
   366
  </p>
  <p>
   man cut slices of bread onto his plate, placed some of the bread into his broth, sprinkled
  </p>
  <p>
   grated cheese on it, added pepper, and devoured it. The man who had been praising
  </p>
  <p>
   his wine regretted what was happening, because he saw his lunch being plundered, and
  </p>
  <p>
   he exclaimed: “Since we have lit the funeral pyre, why don’t we burn up the day on it as
  </p>
  <p>
   well, which is half gone already,112 and happily eat our lunch.” “Let’s do that,” said the
  </p>
  <p>
   man who was devouring the broth-soaked bread. “Each person should request that,
  </p>
  <p>
   whatever he is having prepared for himself for lunch, it should be brought in and placed
  </p>
  <p>
   in the middle of the table for everyone.” Everybody liked that idea. Gallonius said: “I will
  </p>
  <p>
   commit to enough food to suffice for myself and for my two guests.” In the meantime,
  </p>
  <p>
   word arrived that the dynast was asking for his luncheon. Gallonius, spurred on, rushed
  </p>
  <p>
   to prepare whatever was needed. He returned not much later full of leftovers, because
  </p>
  <p>
   the dynast was suffering from indigestion and had not eaten anything besides the broth,
  </p>
  <p>
   leaving the rest of the food untouched. When they saw that the spirits of the dinner
  </p>
  <p>
   guests had been restored, each of them asked the gods if that colicky dynast could be
  </p>
  <p>
   there every time they dined with Gallonius. When they had finished talking, they all
  </p>
  <p>
   removed their shoes, laughed, and reclined at the dining couches.
  </p>
  <p>
   The laughter multiplied when a certain scholar joined in, whom I recalled having
  </p>
  <p>
   seen the day before at the academy meeting. They said that he was a very famous
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher,113 an outstanding orator, and he ventured to ask in that gathering what
  </p>
  <p>
   each person wanted to hear. They all called on the man—who was keen on pleasure
  </p>
  <p>
   112 The Latin phrase literally translates to: “why don’t we burn the day dead on the pyre almost to its
  </p>
  <p>
   navel”; it is from Plaut. Men. I.ii.154-5 (see Chapter 2, n. 232).
  </p>
  <p>
   113 Possibly Kaspar Schoppe (1576-1649), a German humanist and scholar. This is the same philosopher
  </p>
  <p>
   who subjects Flavius Vopiscus Niger and Paulus Aemilius Verus to his teaching methods later in this
  </p>
  <p>
   book.
  </p>
  <p>
   367
  </p>
  <p>
   and devoted to parties and lustful behavior—to approach, remove his shoes, and take a
  </p>
  <p>
   seat. He did not need to be asked twice but walked right over and sat at the head of the
  </p>
  <p>
   table. They ate and drank joyfully. When they were all thoroughly stuffed, a discussion
  </p>
  <p>
   was introduced regarding the women of that city whom, with few exceptions, they found
  </p>
  <p>
   guilty of the crimes of avarice and promiscuity. In order not to seem like I had nothing to
  </p>
  <p>
   say, I said: “Of all the women in the world, I do not believe that any surpass Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   women in terms of chastity and modesty. All of the histories are full of examples, as is
  </p>
  <p>
   the collective memory of antiquity.” The philosopher challenged my words saying: “You
  </p>
  <p>
   seem to me to be truly unschooled in—and a stranger to—Roman history. You have
  </p>
  <p>
   clearly not read what Sallust, the foremost historian of the Romans, left us in writing
  </p>
  <p>
   regarding Fulvia, Sempronia, and many other women of that era.114 Even if you do not
  </p>
  <p>
   know these things, has what Horace, player of the Roman lyre, sang on this subject not
  </p>
  <p>
   reached your ears? I can recite to you his verses by heart:
  </p>
  <p>
   The girl who has just reached puberty enjoys taking lessons in Ionian
  </p>
  <p>
   dancing and is trained in the arts that go with it; even at this stage she
  </p>
  <p>
   contemplates illicit love affairs with total absorption. In due course, when
  </p>
  <p>
   her husband is in his cups, she looks for younger lovers; but she does not
  </p>
  <p>
   select some man to whom she may hurriedly give forbidden pleasures
  </p>
  <p>
   when the lamp has been removed; on the contrary, when sent for quite
  </p>
  <p>
   openly, she gets up, with her husband’s full connivance, whether the caller
  </p>
  <p>
   is some salesman or the captain of some Spanish ship who pays a high
  </p>
  <p>
   price for such degradation.115
  </p>
  <p>
   Could he have expressed more eloquently the character of Roman women so prone to
  </p>
  <p>
   wantonness and excess?”
  </p>
  <p>
   114 Descriptions of Fulvia and Sempronia are found in Sall. Cat. 23 and 25. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV
  </p>
  <p>
   n. 24.

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   I was now trapped with no way out. By way of giving some response, however, I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked: “What have you to say about Lucretia?116 Cannot she, who punished Tarquin’s
  </p>
  <p>
   injury against her the way she did, most rightfully be said to be chief among all chaste
  </p>
  <p>
   women? What could a woman, who is desirous of a good reputation, do more
  </p>
  <p>
   eloquently than bear witness, with her voluntary death, to the pain of having her chastity
  </p>
  <p>
   taken from her, as if a life that does not draw its essence from chastity holds no value?”
  </p>
  <p>
   “My assessment of Lucretia is far different from the one that has been established in the
  </p>
  <p>
   collective imagination,” the philosopher responded. “In fact, I grant her no virtue, nor do
  </p>
  <p>
   I praise her for her restraint.117 When Tarquin violated her, she either accepted the
  </p>
  <p>
   dishonor, or she did not. If she did consent to it, she is undeservedly given pride of
  </p>
  <p>
   place among chaste women. If she did not consent to it, why did she prefer to kill herself
  </p>
  <p>
   after being violated rather than be killed by Tarquin while still a virgin? Perhaps, you will
  </p>
  <p>
   say, it was in order to vindicate herself and her chastity in public opinion. Because, if
  </p>
  <p>
   she had offered her neck to Tarquin immediately, people might have thought that he
  </p>
  <p>
   killed her because she had committed adultery with her servant. Thus, there was
  </p>
  <p>
   something more important to her than her chastity: her reputation, clearly. If she had
  </p>
  <p>
   been led solely by virtue, which does not require the testimony of anyone besides one’s
  </p>
  <p>
   116 The story of Lucretia is found in Liv. I.LVII-LIX. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. II-IV n. 27.
  </p>
  <p>
   117 The challenge that the philosopher mounts to Lucretia’s famed chastity is similar to St. Augustine’s
  </p>
  <p>
   criticism of Lucretia’s actions in City of God, 1.19. Augustine maintains that, if Lucretia was not a willing
  </p>
  <p>
   participant in the sexual encounter with Tarquin, she was not guilty of adultery because she was chaste in
  </p>
  <p>
   her heart; therefore, taking her own life makes Lucretia the murderer of an innocent woman (herself).
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreover, if her desire to kill herself was out of a sense of pudicita to protect her reputation as an
  </p>
  <p>
   upstanding Roman woman, then she is also guilty of pride and not to be lauded as an example to
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian women. Rossi also argues against Lucretia’s chastity in a dialogue titled De verecundia in
  </p>
  <p>
   Dialogorum volumen alterum (Coloniae Ubiorum: Apud Iodocum Kalcovium &amp; socios, 1649). Gerboni
  </p>
  <p>
   (1899: 72) notes that Giambattista Marino casts similar doubt on Lucretia’s chastity in L’Adone (11.53-7)
  </p>
  <p>
   as does Tassoni in La secchia rapita (VIII.66-75).
  </p>
  <p>
   369
  </p>
  <p>
   own conscience, she would not have been so concerned about what people might have
  </p>
  <p>
   said about her. But if we delve into the innermost recesses of this matter, with the gates
  </p>
  <p>
   fully opened through this avenue of suspicion, we can find some crime lurking in it. How
  </p>
  <p>
   was Tarquin able to gain entrance to the woman’s room at bedtime, which was most
  </p>
  <p>
   likely locked with many bolts? Why did her guards fail her? Why did she not cry out
  </p>
  <p>
   when Tarquin assaulted her? Her entire household would have come running and that
  </p>
  <p>
   wicked man would have either stopped before the deed had been committed, or, if he
  </p>
  <p>
   had killed Lucretia while she was resisting him, she would have made it so there were
  </p>
  <p>
   many witnesses to his crime and to her chastity.” The philosopher would never have
  </p>
  <p>
   stopped talking, filled as he was with the flower of Bacchus, if a ruckus that had erupted
  </p>
  <p>
   among the dinner guests had not interrupted him.
  </p>
  <p>
   We then noticed a certain man among those who were snatching food off of the
  </p>
  <p>
   grill. By begging and pleading he had forced them to let him into their group, but as
  </p>
  <p>
   soon as he climbed onto a couch, he began to reach his pushy hands into every platter,
  </p>
  <p>
   grabbing the best sausages of the lot, as if the lunch had been set out just for him. After
  </p>
  <p>
   he had consumed the first round of dishes, a turkey hen was then recruited, which had
  </p>
  <p>
   been arranged on a large serving dish. The turkey hen was seasoned in such a way
  </p>
  <p>
   that, with its aroma, it would not only have roused a sleeping appetite, but would have
  </p>
  <p>
   even resurrected a dead one. This most just man, as if he had been called upon to
  </p>
  <p>
   judge the bird, summoned his slave, whom he had stationed at the entrance ready to do
  </p>
  <p>
   his bidding. When he had convicted the bird, he covered its head and ordered it sent
  </p>
  <p>
   into exile to his own house; and the innocent bird realized that it was made an exile
  </p>
  <p>
   before it could even mount a defense. Having witnessed this, the dinner guests were
  </p>
  <p>
   370
  </p>
  <p>
   astounded, they looked around at each other, and they were transfixed by his
  </p>
  <p>
   shamelessness in a state of silence and incomprehension. The hilarity that had
  </p>
  <p>
   occupied their minds earlier left no room for anger, but everybody hid their pain and
  </p>
  <p>
   continued with the ongoing festivities. The feast was just about nearing its end when a
  </p>
  <p>
   dessert baked in an earthen pot was carried out on a tray, placed on the table, and
  </p>
  <p>
   presented as the grand finale of the lunch. When the man—the one who had ordered
  </p>
  <p>
   the turkey hen to acquire citizenship elsewhere—saw the dessert approaching, he acted
  </p>
  <p>
   according to his nature and ordered the poor thing to be exiled to his house, following in
  </p>
  <p>
   the footsteps of the turkey hen. His servant, who was at the ready, grabbed the dessert
  </p>
  <p>
   by the throat and snatched it away. At that point, the man had exhausted the patience of
  </p>
  <p>
   the dinner guests and everybody cried out in unison: “This surely cannot be tolerated!”
  </p>
  <p>
   One of them, more enraged than the others, yelled: “This dessert will move to a new
  </p>
  <p>
   colony over my dead body!” He grabbed hold of it and began bringing it toward himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other man was taken aback at the violence being done to him. Finally, after being
  </p>
  <p>
   intimidated by everyone’s threats and chided by everyone besieging him with words of
  </p>
  <p>
   reproach, he backed off of his plan and leaned back onto his elbow at the table. When
  </p>
  <p>
   lunch was over, one of the dinner guests, who lived for gambling, asked for some dice
  </p>
  <p>
   and challenged the philosopher to a game. Since sleep had come over us, we got up
  </p>
  <p>
   from the table and went off to Gallonius’s house where we spent the afternoon partly
  </p>
  <p>
   reading and partly resting.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the heat of the day had subsided, Gallonius said: “It’s time for us to go to
  </p>
  <p>
   the Temple of Daphne where everybody is gathering today. From there, that noblest
  </p>
  <p>
   Dynast Alexander, who has passed away, will be borne in a magnificent funeral
  </p>
  <p>
   371
  </p>
  <p>
   procession to the shrine that he had built in order to be buried there. It is the custom
  </p>
  <p>
   here to be buried in a temple of the gods.” I said: “Take us there. I reckon there is no
  </p>
  <p>
   more important a sight to see.” In short, we left the house and came to the Temple of
  </p>
  <p>
   Asclepius,118 which was jam-packed with an enormous crowd. We went in and saw the
  </p>
  <p>
   body of a young man placed in the midst of four candles. Gallonius asked who the
  </p>
  <p>
   deceased man was, and what the people crowded around him were doing there. He
  </p>
  <p>
   responded that the young man was a certain Philotas, for the love of whom two young
  </p>
  <p>
   women had died a few days before; and that Philotas, upon learning of their deaths, fell
  </p>
  <p>
   into a depression and died in the hospital from his affliction. I asked Gallonius what he
  </p>
  <p>
   could tell us about Philotas and about those women and he responded: “The story is
  </p>
  <p>
   worth hearing, but I am not able to tell you what really happened.” Another person said:
  </p>
  <p>
   “If there is reason for you to know, I will recount it to you, and I will tell it to you in as few
  </p>
  <p>
   words as possible.” I replied: “Do tell us, and don’t spare any details. You will be doing
  </p>
  <p>
   us a great favor.” On that account, he began.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In a certain town, on an island very close to this one, where King Theridates119
  </p>
  <p>
   rules over his republic with the highest respect for justice, there lived a virgin of
  </p>
  <p>
   marriageable age, named Olinda, who was not from the best or richest family, but was
  </p>
  <p>
   so elegant and beautiful that she caught everyone’s eye. In particular, she attracted the
  </p>
  <p>
   attention of Philotas, the preeminent man in that community, such that she made his life
  </p>
  <p>
   unhappy and unpleasant. Because the poor man was consumed with love and sorrow,
  </p>
  <p>
   he did what it might have occurred to anyone to do, that is, he allied himself in
  </p>
  <p>
   118 A Homeric hero (the “blameless physician” of the Iliad) as well as a god of healing.
  </p>
  <p>
   119 King Louis XIII of France.
  </p>
  <p>
   372
  </p>
  <p>
   partnership and friendship with the maiden’s father. He was successful in this plan, for
  </p>
  <p>
   he won the father over within a short period of time. Indeed, since he visited the
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden’s house often, and signaled his love to her with his eyes, face, and his very
  </p>
  <p>
   voice, he discovered the same desire and love in her (which rarely happens).
  </p>
  <p>
   “Enjoying the freedom that the customs of that region permit, they could not stop
  </p>
  <p>
   hugging and kissing each other. When their embraces exceeded the bounds of
  </p>
  <p>
   moderation, however, they came under suspicion from Olinda’s parents, who were
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly desirous of a good reputation. For which reason, fearing greatly for their
  </p>
  <p>
   daughter’s chastity at the hands of that man—who was both noble and of a certain
  </p>
  <p>
   age—they decided to protect her with a guard. Since there is no fortification so strong
  </p>
  <p>
   that it cannot eventually be conquered by an enemy’s unrelenting siege, they decided to
  </p>
  <p>
   cut short their daughter’s relationship with the young man and drive him as far away as
  </p>
  <p>
   possible from the boundaries of their household. In brief, they approached the young
  </p>
  <p>
   man, informed him about what they had discovered regarding his love, and explained
  </p>
  <p>
   the damage that would be in store for their daughter if she came to be the subject of
  </p>
  <p>
   common gossip on his account. They begged and pleaded with him not to cause her
  </p>
  <p>
   such dishonor, but to flee from her sight and from their home altogether. The young
  </p>
  <p>
   man responded that he did not want any shame to come to her, nor to cause her any
  </p>
  <p>
   insult himself; that he had already intended to marry her all along; and that he had been
  </p>
  <p>
   led to many of his actions by his confidence in their future marriage. He asked—nay
  </p>
  <p>
   insisted—that they promise her to him as his wife. They pointed out that his social
  </p>
  <p>
   status was not the same as theirs; that they were of modest means and middling
  </p>
  <p>
   nobility, while he was born to the greatest riches and to the most noble parentage; and
  </p>
  <p>
   373
  </p>
  <p>
   that moving up so suddenly from asses to cows, so to speak, was a very dangerous
  </p>
  <p>
   proposition. Next they asked him to seek out another option, another marriage
  </p>
  <p>
   arrangement. After Philotas had finally won them over, he took his leave from them with
  </p>
  <p>
   the promise that they would continue to reflect on the matter and speak with his parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   They wasted no time. They went to Philotas’s parents and told them everything. His
  </p>
  <p>
   parents thanked them and suggested that they find Olinda a husband as soon as
  </p>
  <p>
   possible. (Everyone in that country is at the ready with rash and hasty advice.)
  </p>
  <p>
   “So Olinda’s parents immediately found her a husband, a noble youth to be sure,
  </p>
  <p>
   but of no rank compared with Philotas. The wedding ceremony took place right away,
  </p>
  <p>
   and everything was done quickly and carelessly. But this hasty plan failed to keep the
  </p>
  <p>
   looming force of misfortune away from Olinda’s ruin; in fact, it actually came upon her
  </p>
  <p>
   even more swiftly. After her wedding the reciprocal love between Olinda and Philotas
  </p>
  <p>
   was not diminished, and Philotas could be spotted at all hours of the day in front of
  </p>
  <p>
   Olinda’s house—and not without grave offense to the neighborhood and to Olinda’s
  </p>
  <p>
   husband. In fact, the husband made sure to warn Philotas, through friends, that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   better flee the country entirely, unless he was asking for trouble. As with many
  </p>
  <p>
   noblemen, Philotas displayed a scornful character and arrogance, so he ignored
  </p>
  <p>
   Olinda’s husband and kept visiting her house. Spurred by Philotas’s disrespectful
  </p>
  <p>
   behavior, Olinda’s husband, when he came across him one day (and when Philotas was
  </p>
  <p>
   least expecting it) he struck him with the flat of his sword and forced him to flee. Do not
  </p>
  <p>
   ask what fire this egregious insult ignited in that furious and extraordinarily proud man.
  </p>
  <p>
   Philotas rushed home like a madman, grabbed his sword, and came back. He
  </p>
  <p>
   approached his enemy who was standing at the gate and, as the husband struggled
  </p>
  <p>
   374
  </p>
  <p>
   mightily, Philotas stabbed him right before Olinda’s eyes. The matter was brought to
  </p>
  <p>
   judgment on the spot. They searched for Philotas around the entire island, but he had
  </p>
  <p>
   already escaped and come straight here to Eudemia. But the judge overseeing the
  </p>
  <p>
   case, at the urging of Philotas’s relatives (who were insisting that she had
  </p>
  <p>
   masterminded the murder), ordered Olinda to be seized and thrown in jail. Thus, the
  </p>
  <p>
   poor woman was taken from her parents’ embrace to a court of justice, and from her
  </p>
  <p>
   happy marriage bed to jail.
  </p>
  <p>
   “She had barely set foot inside the jail cell, however, when a new storm flung her
  </p>
  <p>
   onto a different rock. The prison warden’s heart not only inclined toward pity for the
  </p>
  <p>
   prisoner, but also burned with love for her. He came to her at night asking her to oblige
  </p>
  <p>
   him and declared that he wanted to bring her home as his wife, offering his right hand
  </p>
  <p>
   as a pledge of faithfulness to his promise. She responded that now was not the right
  </p>
  <p>
   place for such a pledge, nor was it fitting for a wretched, shabby girl, brought up on
  </p>
  <p>
   capital charges and forced to plead her case in chains, to enter into what would only be
  </p>
  <p>
   a doomed marriage. She suggested he wait until she was released from her shackles.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the man was not easily rebuffed by her words. Since his passion was at its peak,
  </p>
  <p>
   inspired by love—or rather by insanity—he changed plans. He bought a horse, grabbed
  </p>
  <p>
   a bag containing his traveling money, and ran away with Olinda. When they arrived at a
  </p>
  <p>
   forest, the warden, who couldn’t wait any longer to rush into Olinda’s arms, feigned
  </p>
  <p>
   exhaustion, dismounted from his horse, and flung himself into her embrace. She pushed
  </p>
  <p>
   herself away from him, saying that she was still not available. He begged her to help
  </p>
  <p>
   him, to aid a dying man, and he continued in this vein, but to no avail. He threatened her
  </p>
  <p>
   with violence but the outcome was the same. In any case, when he saw that she was
  </p>
  <p>
   375
  </p>
  <p>
   moved no more by threats than by pleading, he resorted to force and struggled to wrest
  </p>
  <p>
   an embrace from her. She fought him off by attacking him with her fingernails and teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
   But she had taken on an unequal match with a mightier opponent.
  </p>
  <p>
   “There was already no way left for her to resist, and she was close to
  </p>
  <p>
   succumbing when a new development brought her certain victory and secured her
  </p>
  <p>
   chastity. While she was struggling, she noticed a dagger hanging from his belt. Acting
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly, she stealthily drew it out and drove it as far as possible into his side, freeing
  </p>
  <p>
   herself from that hateful man’s eager embrace. What should she do now? What was her
  </p>
  <p>
   plan? She was a very young woman alone, she had no friends or companions, and she
  </p>
  <p>
   was in a harsh, deserted, and remote location. She did not lose heart, she did not
  </p>
  <p>
   despair. Instead, she added another crime to her previous one, one that was worthy of a
  </p>
  <p>
   man. She removed her women’s garb and dressed herself in the clothes she had taken
  </p>
  <p>
   off that wretched warden. She grabbed his bag, mounted his horse, and resolved to find
  </p>
  <p>
   her lover, wherever he might be. But she was only equipped as a summer traveler for
  </p>
  <p>
   such a journey. She had not even set foot off the island when she had already used up
  </p>
  <p>
   the small amount of money she had found in the bag, and she had sold the horse
  </p>
  <p>
   besides. Because of this, she needed to contract herself out as a squire to a certain
  </p>
  <p>
   man. This brought new troubles and new headaches.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The man had a maiden daughter who was not unattractive. As soon as the fresh
  </p>
  <p>
   beauty of the squire caught the daughter’s eye, it caused the greatest fire in her heart
  </p>
  <p>
   that a maiden’s breast could bear. But the daughter was in love with something that did
  </p>
  <p>
   not exist; she was chasing smoke and shadow. She signaled her love to the squire, at
  </p>
  <p>
   first with her eyes and then with her face. Olinda, who was seized by a stronger love,
  </p>
  <p>
   376
  </p>
  <p>
   paid her no notice. The maiden, believing that the youth was just inexperienced and
  </p>
  <p>
   slow in the matters of love, expressed with words what the squire was not grasping from
  </p>
  <p>
   her glances, and she begged him to bring her aid in her state of distress. Aware of the
  </p>
  <p>
   sort of aid that was being requested, and knowing that she could not give it, Olinda
  </p>
  <p>
   responded to the maiden’s words with laughter. Believing she was being mocked, the
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden responded: ‘What are you laughing at? Am I a ridiculous sight to you because I
  </p>
  <p>
   am dying? Don’t be so cruel!’ Olinda responded: ‘When you really get to know me, your
  </p>
  <p>
   love for me will immediately vanish, and hatred will take its place. I beg you, if you love
  </p>
  <p>
   me, do not tell your father, or anyone. There is nothing more of the male sex in me than
  </p>
  <p>
   there is in you or your mother. It is up to you to test firsthand what you don’t believe. But
  </p>
  <p>
   if you inquire what the meaning of this getup is, I will tell you: love and mortal danger
  </p>
  <p>
   cast me into these clothes and forced me to pretend I was a man.’ She immediately told
  </p>
  <p>
   the maiden where she was from, whom she loved, whom she had killed, where she was
  </p>
  <p>
   going, and everything else in the order that it happened. Finally, she began to implore
  </p>
  <p>
   the maiden to help her with money, which was the thing she needed most—that is,
  </p>
  <p>
   travel funds so she could quickly get to where she was going. What is that you say? Do
  </p>
  <p>
   you think that the maiden, hit with such surprising news, cast her hope or her love out of
  </p>
  <p>
   her mind? Nothing could be farther from the truth. On the contrary, she held onto both
  </p>
  <p>
   most firmly. She believed what she had read in fairy tales, and what she had heard from
  </p>
  <p>
   old wives’ tales, that, once upon a time, there were women who had been transformed
  </p>
  <p>
   into men.120 She reckoned that the same thing could happen to the one she loved. But
  </p>
  <p>
   120 Examples of ancient tales about women being transformed into men are Ovid’s account of Iphis (Met.
  </p>
  <p>
   IX.666-797), who is raised as a boy by her parents but then actually transformed into a boy by Isis so she
  </p>
  <p>
   can marry Ianthe; and Leucippus, who was born female but transformed into a man by Leto. In Noctes
  </p>
  <p>
   Atticae IX.IV. pr.1 Aulus Gellius describes miraculous instances “de feminis repente versis in mares” (“of
  </p>
  <p>
   377
  </p>
  <p>
   listen to how the story went. Rushing into Olinda’s arms she confirmed that she could
  </p>
  <p>
   not live even one more day without her. ‘What life can I aspire to if I am separated from
  </p>
  <p>
   you? None at all! Cheer up, I am resolved and determined to go with you and to endure
  </p>
  <p>
   the same fate.’ Olinda said many things to dissuade the maiden from this purpose, but it
  </p>
  <p>
   was like talking to a brick wall. To make a long story short, they packed up the gold,
  </p>
  <p>
   silver, and other precious objects, and since her father had left for his country estate,
  </p>
  <p>
   they marched out in this direction.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Because it was a favorable time of year, they arrived quickly and stopped
  </p>
  <p>
   together at an inn. You could see them dressed in men’s clothing wandering throughout
  </p>
  <p>
   the entire city, their outstanding beauty catching everyone’s attention. How many people
  </p>
  <p>
   do you suppose would have disputed that there were women under those clothes? The
  </p>
  <p>
   face of a woman coming in search of her lover was especially obvious. After looking
  </p>
  <p>
   everywhere and investigating everything, Olinda determined that her lover was here in
  </p>
  <p>
   this city. After stealthily tracking him, she finally found him (sad to say) ensconced
  </p>
  <p>
   already for some days in a whorehouse in the company of some prostitute. Out of her
  </p>
  <p>
   mind with grief she cried: ‘Philotas, have you completely forgotten about me? Have I
  </p>
  <p>
   endured so much toil and humiliation for nothing? It is because of you that I am without
  </p>
  <p>
   a homeland and have been behaving like some shameless hussy, while, in the
  </p>
  <p>
   meantime, you’ve been busy having fun and placing the love of a prostitute before our
  </p>
  <p>
   marriage!’ She immediately lost hope and became weak from illness. Incredibly, when
  </p>
  <p>
   women suddenly being transformed into men”), which, in his view, gives credence to Pliny the Elder’s
  </p>
  <p>
   assertion (HN VII.4) that “ex feminis mutari in mares non est fabulosum” (“women turning into men is not
  </p>
  <p>
   just the stuff of fables”). I thank Peter James Dennistoun Bryant for suggesting these examples from
  </p>
  <p>
   mythology of women becoming men.
  </p>
  <p>
   378
  </p>
  <p>
   she became sick, the other woman immediately started to fall ill too, and when the
  </p>
  <p>
   sickness in one of them increased, it also grew in the other. Finally, when one of the
  </p>
  <p>
   women died, the other likewise died the same death. The bodies of both women were
  </p>
  <p>
   carried to the Temple of Cupid on the same day, in the same funeral procession, in the
  </p>
  <p>
   same coffin. One and the same burial was conducted, so that death could not put
  </p>
  <p>
   asunder those souls that love had joined together in life; and so that one and the same
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb would house their bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Let me return to Philotas, who had sent Olinda to her death unaware that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   committed such a terrible deed. As soon as he found out about it (since Olinda had
  </p>
  <p>
   already revealed the whole matter to someone while she was dying), out of breath he
  </p>
  <p>
   hurried immediately to Olinda’s house after she had just then been carried out.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dissolving into tears, he cried: ‘So, my heart, I was the cause of your death? I never
  </p>
  <p>
   understood how much you loved me. Unhappy me that I was not able to enjoy such a
  </p>
  <p>
   gift! But my sickness over you will strip me of my life as well. Departure from this life
  </p>
  <p>
   would be marvelous, if it allowed me to breathe my last in your arms!’ He went to throw
  </p>
  <p>
   himself upon Olinda’s body. He could hardly be restrained and was finally carried away
  </p>
  <p>
   from there, as if dead, to the home of a friend and compatriot. Since his illness was
  </p>
  <p>
   increasing, and it seemed like he could not be sufficiently cared for, this same friend
  </p>
  <p>
   saw to it that he was carried to this hospital here where noblemen are attended to in a
  </p>
  <p>
   suitable place, and as comfortably as possible with food and other amenities. However,
  </p>
  <p>
   on account of the season,121 they found the hospital filled to the brim with sick people.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of this, it was necessary to place him among the commoners until someone in
  </p>
  <p>
   121 Summer was peak season for illnesses like quotidian fever, or malaria (see Chapter 3, n. 26).
  </p>
  <p>
   379
  </p>
  <p>
   this hospital recovered. When this most noble man, the first among his fellow citizens,
  </p>
  <p>
   saw himself cast among the dregs of the city he was overcome by such a force of
  </p>
  <p>
   sickness that he died that very same day. This was the end of the lovers. Thus, as you
  </p>
  <p>
   can see”:
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no one on earth that lives a harder life than the lover, and no one
  </p>
  <p>
   that, if you were wise, you would less wish to be.122
  </p>
  <p>
   The deadly fate of these poor lovers brought tears to our eyes, and there was
  </p>
  <p>
   something I wanted to ask about, but I was distracted by the keening of children that
  </p>
  <p>
   alerted us to an approaching funeral procession, in which the deceased dynast was
  </p>
  <p>
   being carried. Gallonius rushed toward those voices and brought us with him because
  </p>
  <p>
   we were eager to see it. The entire procession was organized as follows: boys walked
  </p>
  <p>
   in front, along with a large number of girls, all of whom had been supported by the
  </p>
  <p>
   charity of the deceased. Next came the various guilds that had been under his
  </p>
  <p>
   protection. Many mourners dressed in white followed them, who were singing a doleful
  </p>
  <p>
   and sad song to the gods of the Underworld in a voice that was modulated to a plaintive
  </p>
  <p>
   tone. Then the body of the dynast was carried, surrounded by forty candles, on a bier
  </p>
  <p>
   that was covered in gold and purple cloth. As a sign of respect the rest of the dynasts,
  </p>
  <p>
   walking in pairs, followed the funeral procession, after all the members of their own
  </p>
  <p>
   household—and a great number of their own attendants—had gone on ahead. Quite a
  </p>
  <p>
   few ushers were managing the procession surrounded by lictors dressed in black.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wherever the funeral procession went, the streets resounded with cries and the
  </p>
  <p>
   heavens rung out with words such as these:
  </p>
  <p>
   122 Prop. II.XVII.9-10; translation from Horace and Goold 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   380
  </p>
  <p>
   Now is the time for shedding tears and for pouring forth complaints and
  </p>
  <p>
   lamentations in sad song. Now is the time to don a black cloak and
  </p>
  <p>
   conceal your bright clothes. Alas, Alexander—that eminent and renowned
  </p>
  <p>
   man on whom the sun rose and set—has died an untimely death, like a
  </p>
  <p>
   flower scattered about by a fast whirlwind. Rome itself, founded atop a hill,
  </p>
  <p>
   does not stand as high, nor does a torch burn as bright, as honesty,
  </p>
  <p>
   justice, faith, and simple truth shone in his pure heart. O death, long
  </p>
  <p>
   accustomed to cut down with your scythe those who did not deserve to
  </p>
  <p>
   die, while leaving the worst ones untouched, were you able (you savage!)
  </p>
  <p>
   to witness such grief without pity? Did the long train of pious citizens not
  </p>
  <p>
   move you, who were endlessly lamenting, with mournful voices, that the
  </p>
  <p>
   aid, which they and their loved ones depended on in hard times, was
  </p>
  <p>
   being taken away? Others were crying out: “Who will clothe those who
  </p>
  <p>
   would keep the cold at bay from their naked bodies?” The widows were
  </p>
  <p>
   demanding: “Who will share their meal with sons who have lost their
  </p>
  <p>
   father?”
  </p>
  <p>
   The benevolent townspeople proclaimed these and similar things about Dynast
  </p>
  <p>
   Alexander in his presence. For this reason, it was unanimously decided, then and there,
  </p>
  <p>
   that oftentimes it was Fortune rather than hard work or diligence that benefited men in
  </p>
  <p>
   search of renown. That dynast, who was being received in death with such favorable
  </p>
  <p>
   acclaim by the people, had drawn acclamation based solely on a belief in his generosity
  </p>
  <p>
   and benevolence, even though he was not very learned and had not achieved any glory
  </p>
  <p>
   from his deeds. Among other things, his fortune was attributed to the fact that he died
  </p>
  <p>
   when he had not yet experienced any other lot.123 We did notice that the words of praise
  </p>
  <p>
   for Alexander’s nephew were mixed in with continuous lamentations of public
  </p>
  <p>
   mourning.124 They spread the word that the nephew would surpass his uncle in dignity
  </p>
  <p>
   123 The English here is informed by the Livy and Foster (1948-59) translation of Liv. IX.XVII. That Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin is inspired by this passage in Livy is fitting, since it is about Alexander the Great (Rossi is using it in
  </p>
  <p>
   reference to Dynast Alexander) and is similarly hedging in its outright praise of an important figure. Just
  </p>
  <p>
   as Livy tempers his praise by saying that Alexander died young (implying that he may not always have
  </p>
  <p>
   remained a great leader), Rossi tempers his praise by implying that Dynast Alexander had not actually
  </p>
  <p>
   accomplished much beyond being a generous patron.
  </p>
  <p>
   124 Cardinal Alessandro Peretti di Montalto’s nephew was Francesco Peretti di Montalto (1597-1655).
  </p>
  <p>
   Francesco was elevated by Urban VIII to the cardinalate in 1641.
  </p>
  <p>
   381
  </p>
  <p>
   and glory on account of the integrity and elegance of his life, and especially on account
  </p>
  <p>
   of his studies of the best literature.
  </p>
  <p>
   The time of day reminded us to think about dinner, so Gallonius sent his servant
  </p>
  <p>
   to go shopping. In the meantime, a ship’s captain was brought to us who was going to
  </p>
  <p>
   set sail the day after tomorrow (if the winds proved favorable) for an island that
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone said was very beautiful and fertile, and whose inhabitants were peaceful,
  </p>
  <p>
   cheerful, agreeable, and pleasant. We came to an agreement with the captain on a fare
  </p>
  <p>
   for the voyage. Afterward, we began to head for a nearby fountain so we could shake
  </p>
  <p>
   off the heat that was sticking to our bodies, but someone riding in a carriage blocked our
  </p>
  <p>
   way. In a loud voice the man said: “Gallonius, just the person I’ve been looking for!
  </p>
  <p>
   Please, if you are not busy, give me your attention for a bit. I must consult with you.” “I
  </p>
  <p>
   serve at your pleasure,” replied Gallonius. Approaching Gallonius, the man whispered a
  </p>
  <p>
   few words in his ear and asked him to pass them on to his dynast. Afterward, he
  </p>
  <p>
   inquired where we were just coming from. Gallonius responded: “From the Temple of
  </p>
  <p>
   Daphne where I had taken these two young men, my compatriots. They are noble men,
  </p>
  <p>
   devoted to letters, and they participated with great pleasure yesterday in our academic
  </p>
  <p>
   endeavors.” Turning toward us, the man said: “How I wish you could have been there
  </p>
  <p>
   two weeks ago! I demonstrated, in elegant terms, that all solid objects are transparent
  </p>
  <p>
   and that the element earth, when separated from these lower elements, extends up to
  </p>
  <p>
   the heavens.” Then he asked me if I had heard anything elegant and witty in that
  </p>
  <p>
   gathering, to which I responded: “Many things, but most of all I was extraordinarily
  </p>
  <p>
   entertained by the ingenuity of Hiero, who elicited such abundant praise for a gnat, an
  </p>
  <p>
   insignificant insect.” Enthusiastically confirming the young Gallutius’s talent for poetry,
  </p>
  <p>
   382
  </p>
  <p>
   he then asked: “Did he, by any chance, recite the poem in which he expounds his praise
  </p>
  <p>
   for Spring? I read it because his father showed it to me. But who is the best poet to
  </p>
  <p>
   imitate, in your opinion?” “I believe Virgil is the prince of poets.” To which the man
  </p>
  <p>
   replied: “On that score, he has disappointed me. I am sorry to hear that the quick and
  </p>
  <p>
   sublime mind of that excellent young man is being stymied by being linked to the
  </p>
  <p>
   sluggishness and baseness of Virgil, and by not daring to elevate itself higher.” What
  </p>
  <p>
   are you saying?” I replied. “Does Virgil seem to you to crawl on the ground?”125 “He
  </p>
  <p>
   would also seem to you to crawl on the ground if you read my poetry,” he responded.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I said: “So you are more learned than Virgil?” “More learned?” he said, “What are
  </p>
  <p>
   you saying? I would be embarrassed to compose verses that were anything like Virgil’s.
  </p>
  <p>
   If I gave the order, I could remove that talentless and barely educated author from my
  </p>
  <p>
   library. Listen to what I wrote on the very subject of Spring, and dare to compare Virgil’s
  </p>
  <p>
   meagerness with my rich abundance of subjects and vocabulary”:
  </p>
  <p>
   Once Spring126 has resolved to bring an end to the fierce wars of frozen
  </p>
  <p>
   winter and to the dreadful clash of the elements, behold, shining, she
  </p>
  <p>
   displays her footsteps on tall Mount Olympus, and, wherever she walks,
  </p>
  <p>
   she offers lilies with full hands; and Zephyrus127 catches the goddess’s
  </p>
  <p>
   nose with his fragrance and, with a welcome murmur, lays down a
  </p>
  <p>
   tapestry decorated with flowers, green foliage, and snow-white plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next the elements, under the gaze of the approaching goddess, set down
  </p>
  <p>
   their weapons and, subdued by fear, quickly seek out their dwelling
  </p>
  <p>
   places; the battalions of hateful winter give the order to decamp and,
  </p>
  <p>
   lacking energy, they do not dare fight back on equal terms, but they bring
  </p>
  <p>
   125 The Latin phrase “humi serpere” (to crawl on the ground) is used to refer to poetic style that is dull and
  </p>
  <p>
   does not rise to lofty heights. See Hor. Epist. II.I.250, Hor. Ars P. 28. Erasmus (Adagia 2.10.88) defines
  </p>
  <p>
   the phrase this way: “Humi serpit oratio, quae pressior humiliorque est quam oportet, semper quasi
  </p>
  <p>
   jacens, nunquam assurgens” (“speech crawls on the ground if it is plainer and in a lower register than it
  </p>
  <p>
   needs to be, as if it it always remains dull and lifeless and is never lofty or soaring”).

  <p>
   127 Zephyrus: the West Wind. It is the gentlest of the winds and, with its fructifying quality, it was
  </p>
  <p>
   considered the harbinger of spring.
  </p>
  <p>
   383
  </p>
  <p>
   new battles to a different region of the earth. Spring hurls a bolt of love
  </p>
  <p>
   from her brow and disperses swollen rage from the spirit of warring
  </p>
  <p>
   peoples; fake kisses of a false peace take over, together with simulated
  </p>
  <p>
   love joined with feigned concord, which the savage season of cold winter
  </p>
  <p>
   later beats back with icy cold blows summoning their anger, which had
  </p>
  <p>
   been banished, back into power. In the meantime, her laughter forbids any
  </p>
  <p>
   rain clouds in the sky, and angry Notus128 ceases to hurl lightning bolts, or
  </p>
  <p>
   darts of hail, from his rigid bow. Instead, Favonius’s fertile breeze, glowing
  </p>
  <p>
   red, fills the pregnant earth’s womb with soft beads of dew, sprinkling it
  </p>
  <p>
   with beauty. But when the goddess, happily in labor, produces and
  </p>
  <p>
   scatters flowers, she surpasses laboring Lucina in her duties. Afterward,
  </p>
  <p>
   sitting on her brilliant throne, the queen inspects the armies of plants
  </p>
  <p>
   under her command throughout all the lands. She also condemns those
  </p>
  <p>
   plants of hers to the fire, which do not know how to pay a profit of seed
  </p>
  <p>
   and fruit to Nature. Everyone suddenly rushes in, clothed in green, and
  </p>
  <p>
   she, hurrying, bends over and, pulling back her hands, marks the all-
  </p>
  <p>
   sustaining earth. She raises her head, veiled in branches, and kisses the
  </p>
  <p>
   clouds. So as to appear limpid in its snow-white vestments, the river, after
  </p>
  <p>
   ridding itself of foreign sediment and returning to a pure element, clothes
  </p>
  <p>
   itself completely in brightness. Behold, her roving retinue of flowers places
  </p>
  <p>
   grateful kisses on the goddess’s hands; the lovely rose, surpassing all the
  </p>
  <p>
   rest, bears on its face the mark of modesty. All the while the songbirds,
  </p>
  <p>
   the beautiful lyre players of the countryside, rush willingly toward Spring’s
  </p>
  <p>
   footsteps, and everywhere they pour forth sweet songs from their
  </p>
  <p>
   melodious throats, which she, thirsty, avidly drinks down with her ears
  </p>
  <p>
   and, tipsy, lies down, won over by languid sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Tell me the truth, have your ears ever heard anything more perfect than this
  </p>
  <p>
   poem, either in terms of greatness of spirit or in figures of speech and ideas? Look how
  </p>
  <p>
   it washes over your senses, how it delights them, how the number of ideas is equal to
  </p>
  <p>
   the number of words! I was the first129 to elegantly invent this style of writing; I made it
  </p>
  <p>
   famous and fashionable; I opened the way and, imprinting it with my footsteps, showed
  </p>
  <p>
   it to whoever might wish to follow and to arrive at eternal fame with no detours. Take
  </p>
  <p>
   this poem, written in my own hand, and adopt it as your teacher for writing poetry.”

  <p>
   129 A similar declaration of being a pioneer of a specific genre (“ego primus”) is found, for example, in
  </p>
  <p>
   Horace’s Epist. I.XIX., addressed to Maecenas, in which he claims for himself the mantle of the first
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman poet to adapt Alcaic meter to Latin.

  </p>
  <p>
   While I was accepting his poem and thanking him, Gallonius said: “If you read his
  </p>
  <p>
   letters, you would absolutely think that, according to the doctrines of Pythagoras, the
  </p>
  <p>
   soul of Cicero had migrated into him, or that his eloquence had come to him as a
  </p>
  <p>
   birthright.” When he heard these words, he was deeply distraught and said: “You do me
  </p>
  <p>
   a dishonor. One line or another of any of my writings is worth more than a hundred
  </p>
  <p>
   letters of Cicero. Good god, what does that orator have besides a fast-moving gallop of
  </p>
  <p>
   words and flagging speech without force or energy.”130 A certain dynast, who was
  </p>
  <p>
   returning from Alexander’s funeral, lifted him into his carriage and out of our sight,
  </p>
  <p>
   preventing him from saying any more words against Cicero. Afterward, I asked
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius if there was anyone in his right mind who had that man as a patron. “Why?”
  </p>
  <p>
   he asked. “Because he is mad.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Without delay, we arrived at an abundantly flowing fountain. There we were
  </p>
  <p>
   accosted by that philosopher, who, at lunch, had leveled the charge of promiscuity at
  </p>
  <p>
   just about every woman. When we caught sight of him, Gallonius nodded to us to turn
  </p>
  <p>
   back and escape from that annoyance. But the philosopher’s shrewdness thwarted our
  </p>
  <p>
   plan, and he stopped me by grabbing me by my cloak saying: “Where are you rushing
  </p>
  <p>
   off to? I beg you to stay, as I would like to enter into a lasting pact of friendship with you.
  </p>
  <p>
   I discovered from today’s discussion that you are not unfamiliar with literature.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Grabbing my hand, he said: “When you get to know me, you will place me above other
  </p>
  <p>
   learned men. If you were sworn to identify the best orator or the most learned
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher, you would not name anyone but me. I alone, therefore, am a teacher
  </p>
  <p>
   130 These terms applied to style (in Latin nervi, sanguinis, flaccens oratio) are central to discussions on
  </p>
  <p>
   style such as those in Cic. Brut. and Hor. Ars P.
  </p>
  <p>
   385
  </p>
  <p>
   above all the others. In fact, I do not teach students in the way that other scholars do,
  </p>
  <p>
   who force their students to waste away in schools, but I lead them to the highest summit
  </p>
  <p>
   of philosophy via a much shorter method and path. I was the first to discover this path
  </p>
  <p>
   and, if it does not pain you to walk it, I will declare myself your companion and your
  </p>
  <p>
   guide. But you will not be able to embark on this path until you have had a sampling of
  </p>
  <p>
   my genius. Since I have noticed that you have more familiarity with historians and
  </p>
  <p>
   orators than you do with the masters of other arts, I will present you with the model of
  </p>
  <p>
   the whole art of rhetoric, which I have copied onto my writing tablets. Once you have
  </p>
  <p>
   fixed these in your memory, as if on a wall, everything that rhetoric has to transmit will
  </p>
  <p>
   be available to you at a glance.” “I beg you to go easy,” said Gallonius. “Don’t wear
  </p>
  <p>
   yourself out and add more annoyance than this heat is already causing.” He replied:
  </p>
  <p>
   “You will never master it without my advice today on the subject.” Since it was not going
  </p>
  <p>
   to turn out any other way, I stretched out my neck and handed myself over to my
  </p>
  <p>
   executioner.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thus, he began: “The first panel begins with the definition of rhetoric, which is the
  </p>
  <p>
   ability to see what in any matter might be persuasive.131 Next, I show what the function
  </p>
  <p>
   of rhetoric is, namely to speak in a manner suitable for persuasion. Third, I explain the
  </p>
  <p>
   131 This is almost a direct quote from Quint. Inst. II.XV.16. This blowhard philosopher, who just declared
  </p>
  <p>
   himself the “first to discover this path” to the mastery of rhetoric, lifts the definition, function, and causes of
  </p>
  <p>
   rhetoric almost word for word from sections of Cicero’s De inventione and Rhetorica ad Herennium (the
  </p>
  <p>
   latter once thought to be a work of Ciceronian iuvenilia but now considered spurious). Rossi knows his
  </p>
  <p>
   readers would instantly recognize these references, since these two books were basic school texts for
  </p>
  <p>
   anyone who received a humanistic education. Despite being best known today for his mature oratorical
  </p>
  <p>
   and philosophical works, Cicero’s reputation in the middle ages and the Renaissance derived from these
  </p>
  <p>
   early works (Ward 2013: 163-96). See also Ward 2006: 3-75; Juys, Ward, and Heyworth 2013. Cipriano
  </p>
  <p>
   Suárez’s De arte rhetorica libri tres ex Aristotele, Cicerone &amp; Quintiliano praecipue deprompti (first edition
  </p>
  <p>
   Hispali: ex officina Alphonsi Escriuani, 1569) was a frequently used textbook for teaching rhetoric in
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesuit institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   386
  </p>
  <p>
   causes of rhetoric.132 First is the efficient cause, which consists of invention and
  </p>
  <p>
   doctrine. Invention133 is the depiction and observation of one’s nature. One’s nature is
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing other than an innate aptitude and talent for speaking. Doctrine, on the other
  </p>
  <p>
   hand, includes theory and practice. Theory is a set of rules that provides a method for
  </p>
  <p>
   speaking, while practice is the constant exercise and experience in speaking. Next
  </p>
  <p>
   comes the final cause: to persuade by speaking. The third is the material cause, which
  </p>
  <p>
   is defined as the issue involved with the circumstances of any matter. Finally, this panel
  </p>
  <p>
   concludes with a description of the three types of cases: epideictic, judicial, and
  </p>
  <p>
   deliberative. Epideictic rhetoric comprises praise and blame, namely the amplification of
  </p>
  <p>
   the good or bad aspects that we assert are in a matter. Its end is to portray honor or
  </p>
  <p>
   disgrace; its goal, the pleasure of the audience; its tense is present. Judicial rhetoric is
  </p>
  <p>
   found within the context of forensic debate and it consists of a criminal charge with a
  </p>
  <p>
   defense. The aim of judicial rhetoric is to determine right and wrong, its goal or end
  </p>
  <p>
   being the clemency or severity of the judge. A judicial oration should be delivered in the
  </p>
  <p>
   past tense. Moreover, all judicial oratory involves either a criminal case or a legal
  </p>
  <p>
   controversy. There are two types of oratory related to a criminal case: an accusation,
  </p>
  <p>
   which brings a formal charge, and a defense, which seeks to remove a charge. There
  </p>
  <p>
   are also two types of oratory related to a legal controversy: a civil action, in which
  </p>
  <p>
   someone is suing another party; or a counterplea, in which someone disputes that the
  </p>
  <p>
   other party is owed anything. Deliberative oratory comes next, which is used in the
  </p>
  <p>
   132 The four causes of rhetoric as defined by Aristotle are: efficient, final, material, and formal. Our
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher only discusses the first three.
  </p>
  <p>
   133 Invention is one of the five canons of rhetoric (the others are arrangement, style, memory, and
  </p>
  <p>
   delivery).
  </p>
  <p>
   387
  </p>
  <p>
   context of a general inquiry concerning advice or a recommendation, and it involves the
  </p>
  <p>
   delivery of an opinion. The aim of deliberative oratory is to determine what is
  </p>
  <p>
   advantageous and disadvantageous, and its goal is the hope or fear of the person
  </p>
  <p>
   deliberating. Deliberative oratory should be delivered in the future tense. It is composed
  </p>
  <p>
   of persuasion, which instructs as to what should be done, and objection, which supports
  </p>
  <p>
   the opposite. That is the end of the first panel, in which I portray the arrangement of
  </p>
  <p>
   rhetoric no less realistically than if it had been depicted by the hand of Apelles or
  </p>
  <p>
   Zeuxis.134 Turn your attention now to the next panel, which places the parts and the
  </p>
  <p>
   duties of the orator as if before your very eyes.”
  </p>
  <p>
   At that point Gallonius lost his patience and said: “Hold on, I am thinking of
  </p>
  <p>
   inviting you to dinner the day after tomorrow. Then, when I am at leisure, I want to see
  </p>
  <p>
   these tablets you are telling us about. Their splendor demands not a brief sojourn, but
  </p>
  <p>
   ample time to contemplate them, which today, being almost at an end, does not
  </p>
  <p>
   accommodate. After all, you are familiar with my responsibilities.” The philosopher,
  </p>
  <p>
   hearing talk of dinner, lit up and, with a joyful voice, said: “I agree. I will offer up the
  </p>
  <p>
   wealth of my talents at your house, with the great advantage that it brings, and at the
  </p>
  <p>
   same time, I will propose what I have said and will say written out on little cards or
  </p>
  <p>
   panels. And if this man here entrusts himself to me for about a month, he will gain a
  </p>
  <p>
   familiarity with logic, physics and metaphysics, not just by some birthmark or a rattle but
  </p>
  <p>
   by their whole body.135 He will tack to the walls of his room the depictions of these fields
  </p>
  <p>
   134 Two famous ancient Greek painters. Pliny the Elder dates Apelles of Kos to 332 BCE because he
  </p>
  <p>
   painted a portrait of Alexander the Great. Zeuxis of Heraclea was active in the late fifth century BCE.
  </p>
  <p>
   135 This is a quote from Cic. Brut. 313 and is a reference to the marks of identification or recognition (like a
  </p>
  <p>
   birthmark or a child’s rattle) that serve to resolve the plots in ancient comic plays (see Cicero and G. L.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hendrickson 1952: 271 n. b).

  <p>
   388
  </p>
  <p>
   of study that I describe on my panels, as if he had created an art gallery, but one much
  </p>
  <p>
   more elegant than the pictures in which we celebrate the hands of Polyclitus, Zeuxis,
  </p>
  <p>
   Protogenes, and Parrhasius.”136
  </p>
  <p>
   After I had praised the man’s learning, I followed after Gallonius as he was
  </p>
  <p>
   leaving. Gallonius said: “If I had not brought up the topic of dinner, that leech would
  </p>
  <p>
   never have let us go. For god’s sake, did you see how that inept man cleverly debates
  </p>
  <p>
   very serious matters in whatever place and among whatever men he pleases?” Worn
  </p>
  <p>
   out by visions of the insane, I said: “Please, Gallonius, let us get out of here quickly, in
  </p>
  <p>
   case some other fool starts annoying us to death. We came here under a curse of the
  </p>
  <p>
   gods.” Gallonius responded: “You’re one to talk! As if it weren’t possible to find a much
  </p>
  <p>
   larger quantity of stupid people like this in Rome!” “True,” I said. “I don’t have anything
  </p>
  <p>
   else to say, except that nobody is born without faults, and it is impossible to find any
  </p>
  <p>
   place anywhere that is inhabited by perfect people.” Discussing these and other things
  </p>
  <p>
   we returned home where we discovered that the servant, whom Gallonius had sent
  </p>
  <p>
   ahead of us to the store, had not only returned from shopping but had already cooked
  </p>
  <p>
   us dinner. After we had eaten it in good cheer, and after many and wide-ranging
  </p>
  <p>
   conversations, we took ourselves off to bed and gave ourselves over completely to
  </p>
  <p>
   stillness and sleep until dawn.

   136 Famous ancient Greek sculptors and painters. Polyclitus, active between 450 and 420 BCE, was
  </p>
  <p>
   probably a native of Argos (though Pliny says he was from Sicyon). Protogenes of Caunus (or Xanthus)
  </p>
  <p>
   was a painter and a sculptor; he was active in the late fourth century BCE and had a friendly rivalry with
  </p>
  <p>
   Apelles. Parrhasius of Ephesus, active in the later fifth century BCE, created such realistic images that,
  </p>
  <p>
   according to an anecdote by Pliny the Elder, he tricked Zeuxis into believing that some curtains he
  </p>
  <p>
   painted were real (Oxford Dicitonary of Art and Artists, 4th ed.).

  </p>
  <p>
   Because we had no obligations requiring us to get up early, we slept in very late
  </p>
  <p>
   the following morning. When both the time of day and our empty, barking stomachs
  </p>
  <p>
   started demanding food we called for our undershirts, waistcoats, trousers, and
  </p>
  <p>
   leggings. When we were dressed Gallonius said: “After my dynast has finished eating I
  </p>
  <p>
   think I’ll take you to the senate house. You will enjoy looking at the bronze and marble
  </p>
  <p>
   statues there, as well as the paintings created by the hands of our best artists. It is
  </p>
  <p>
   common practice to hold sessions of the senate, and to train and maintain magistrates,
  </p>
  <p>
   in villas that are filled with such art objects. The senate is where the poliarchs137 (that is
  </p>
  <p>
   what those particular magistrates are called) hear and adjudicate the cases of people
  </p>
  <p>
   who appear before that court. A long time ago, before this Republic had come under the
  </p>
  <p>
   power and guidance of the dynasts, the most important cases and policies fell to the
  </p>
  <p>
   decision and judgment of the people, because it was in them that the supreme power
  </p>
  <p>
   and authority was located. So as not to be completely stripped of their power after the
  </p>
  <p>
   Republic’s wealth had been depleted by civil unrest, and after they had entrusted
  </p>
  <p>
   themselves to the dynasts, the people retained control over the administration of certain
  </p>
  <p>
   matters; namely, they made sure that fraud was removed from all transactions of buying
  </p>
  <p>
   and selling, particularly of foodstuffs, and that there was a uniformity with regard to
  </p>
  <p>
   measurements and weights.
  </p>
  <p>
   The poliarchs set the prices for most goods, establishing quantities and weights,
  </p>
  <p>
   and if some crime is committed—for example, if an item has been sold for a greater
  </p>
  <p>
   137 Poliarchs are the equivalent of Roman senators. Poliarchus also happens to be the name of the
  </p>
  <p>
   mysterious nobleman suitor (eventually revealed to be the King of France) of the princess Argenis in John
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclay’s eponymous novel.
  </p>
  <p>
   390
  </p>
  <p>
   price or if an ounce or two ounces has been taken from the pound138—it is the poliarchs
  </p>
  <p>
   who determine appropriate penalties and punishments. The poliarchs have appointed
  </p>
  <p>
   certain people to keep an eye out for fraud. These people go around every morning to
  </p>
  <p>
   the butcher shops, taverns, and marketplaces and, when they encounter anyone
  </p>
  <p>
   carrying meat, wine, fish, bacon, or anything of that sort, they stop him, ask where he
  </p>
  <p>
   bought it and for how much, and they weigh it with a scale that they carry with them for
  </p>
  <p>
   that purpose, or they measure it with a half-pint measuring cup. If these monitors come
  </p>
  <p>
   to discover that the purchased items do not correspond to the established measure and
  </p>
  <p>
   weight, they force the seller to return what he has fraudulently acquired, and they report
  </p>
  <p>
   his name to the poliarchs. Because the poliarchs trust the people reporting to them and
  </p>
  <p>
   do not require further proof, they either levy a fine against the guilty party, or they make
  </p>
  <p>
   him pay in the form of some sort of corporal punishment. It was for this reason that this
  </p>
  <p>
   type of responsibility was once given to the best and the richest men, whose testimony
  </p>
  <p>
   was credible, so there would be no suspicion that any money had changed hands. Now,
  </p>
  <p>
   however, the dominant practice is that, among those who wield power in this Republic, it
  </p>
  <p>
   is the ones with the least amount of money who are drawn to these positions. Because
  </p>
  <p>
   of this, thieves who are caught red-handed often escape their just punishments for a
  </p>
  <p>
   small fee, since the bonds of law and justice that used to keep them in check have been
  </p>
  <p>
   severed.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I (speaking also for Paulus) said: “Gallonius, there is nothing we would
  </p>
  <p>
   rather see than this senate house you speak of.” He replied: “I will soon satisfy your
  </p>
  <p>
   desire. Let’s be off.” We had only just set foot outside the house when we saw a man,
  </p>
  <p>
   138 The Latin refers to Roman measurements: “if an ‘uncia’ or a ‘sextans’ has been taken from the ‘as.’”
  </p>
  <p>
   391
  </p>
  <p>
   with an honest face and elegant dress, knocking on someone’s front door. A woman
  </p>
  <p>
   called out from the window: “Who is banging on my door?” “It’s me,” he replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Somebody please open the door.” She answered: “You came just in time, sir; we don’t
  </p>
  <p>
   have any vegetables in the house for lunch. Go buy an obol’s worth,139 if it’s not too
  </p>
  <p>
   much trouble.” He replied: “Good thinking. I’ll go fetch some. Make sure lunch is ready
  </p>
  <p>
   when I get back.” “Yes, sir,” she said. “Off you go with the gods’ blessing.” Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “How charmingly that maidservant has kept her master away from the house! If
  </p>
  <p>
   you don’t mind hanging around here for a bit, you will witness some very delightful
  </p>
  <p>
   shenanigans. The lady of the house is beautiful and in the bloom of youth. She is the
  </p>
  <p>
   wife of that man who has just been sent off to buy vegetables. She is having an affair
  </p>
  <p>
   with a wealthy tax collector, in cahoots with her husband. But in order to turn the tax
  </p>
  <p>
   collector into Phryxus’s ram140 and fleece him out of his gold right down to his hide, she
  </p>
  <p>
   has persuaded him that she is consenting without her husband’s knowledge. She said:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘If he gets wind of any of this, even a little bit, we will all be done for. He is an angry,
  </p>
  <p>
   violent, and savage man, and you will meet the usual fate of adulterers.’ In truth,
  </p>
  <p>
   though, there is no gentler a fool than that billy goat, nor one who is more under the
  </p>
  <p>
   thumb of his wife. Nevertheless, in order to provide a reason for the tax collector to be
  </p>
  <p>
   afraid, the husband and wife decided that if, upon returning home (and after she had
  </p>
  <p>
   given a signal), the husband was to discover that the adulterer was inside, he would find
  </p>
  <p>
   some excuse to stay away from the house until the adulterer came running outside.”
  </p>
  <p>
   139 An obol is a small Greek coin, the sixth part of a drachma, which is worth about the same as the
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman denarius.
  </p>
  <p>
   140 Phryxus was rescued from his stepmother by a ram with a golden fleece, who carried him to safety
  </p>
  <p>
   over the Hellespont (named for his twin sister who fell from the ram and did not make it). This is the same
  </p>
  <p>
   golden fleece that Jason later recovered with the aid of Medea.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Hardly had Gallonius recounted this than—you guessed it—the doors burst open and
  </p>
  <p>
   spit the adulterer out. “What did I tell you?” said Gallonius. “How about that! If we had
  </p>
  <p>
   time to hang around here longer, and I were not, as you know, being summoned
  </p>
  <p>
   elsewhere, you would see porters flying over here with baskets carrying that stinking
  </p>
  <p>
   goat a hot lunch. This land is filled with these sorts of people, and it is no wonder that
  </p>
  <p>
   their number has greatly increased, for this business is by far the most profitable. This is
  </p>
  <p>
   a way for a man to accrue riches, enjoyment, and offices, and to attract the delight and
  </p>
  <p>
   devotion of the nobility. For this reason, if such a man chances upon a reasonably
  </p>
  <p>
   attractive woman—and if she is for sale—gift bearers run to him in whole regiments141
  </p>
  <p>
   with gold, clothing, and everything he needs. This practice thrives above all else
  </p>
  <p>
   because, as I have said, wealth is held in high esteem, while poverty is thought to be for
  </p>
  <p>
   the disgraced; leisure and luxury are sought after, while hard work and humility are
  </p>
  <p>
   shunned.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But there are different kinds of husbands. Some are not secretive and silent in
  </p>
  <p>
   their shamelessness but are public and open about it. As far as they are concerned, so
  </p>
  <p>
   long as they have something to eat and drink, they do not care what people say about
  </p>
  <p>
   them on a daily basis. Other, slightly more honorable husbands want the public to think
  </p>
  <p>
   they do not know what they know and do not see what they see, even though they have
  </p>
  <p>
   the same desire to consume more than they can manage and indulge in clothes. In
  </p>
  <p>
   order to grant adulterers freer access to their wives, they often ride out to the country,
  </p>
  <p>
   and they sometimes remain away from their hometown, and from their homes, for
  </p>
  <p>
   141 The Latin word is maniplatim (i.e., manipulatim), which means “in whole maniples.” “There were 120
  </p>
  <p>
   men in each maniple of the velites, hastati, and principes of the Roman army, and 60 in each maniple of
  </p>
  <p>
   the triarii. Four maniples made a cohort” (Plautus and Leo 1895: n. 6 to Pseud.).
  </p>
  <p>
   393
  </p>
  <p>
   months at a time. If one of these powerful men possesses an unrestrained spirit and
  </p>
  <p>
   wants to keep the other men’s wives with him, it happens fairly often that the husbands
  </p>
  <p>
   are put in charge of a trireme or of a town, so they not only stay away from home while
  </p>
  <p>
   they are at sea or governing a town, but they do so gladly with honors and benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   When these men return home, their wives welcome them cheerfully and joyously and
  </p>
  <p>
   wrap them up in an embrace. One wife pulls out a purple and gold necklace; another
  </p>
  <p>
   shows off a canopy, a rug, and ivory couches; another opens the pantry, wine cellar,
  </p>
  <p>
   and granary to show off the grain that will last their family a whole year. She says: ‘Look
  </p>
  <p>
   what my mother and my sister gave me for my birthday, and what my in-laws sent me
  </p>
  <p>
   for Quinquatria, Compitalia,142 and the Circus Games!’ These good men happily believe
  </p>
  <p>
   their wives and do not think that the matter needs to be scrutinized more closely. They
  </p>
  <p>
   even say that it is this great multitude of whores that has produced the huge expenses
  </p>
  <p>
   we are laboring under nowadays. Don’t you see those women who command a retinue
  </p>
  <p>
   of maidservants and go around adorned with gold and dressed like queens? In fact, if
  </p>
  <p>
   these husbands are unable to provide for their wives’ expenses, they urge them to take
  </p>
  <p>
   many lovers, who divvy up the terrain among themselves, so that one lover sees to her
  </p>
  <p>
   headdress, another to adorning her neck, another to her hair, another to her pantry, and
  </p>
  <p>
   another to her table.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While Gallonius was telling us these things, we inadvertently walked right past
  </p>
  <p>
   his dynast’s house. When we realized this, we turned back and went in at the very
  </p>
  <p>
   moment he was ordering the master of the feast to prepare the dining couches for him.
  </p>
  <p>
   142 The Quinquatria, or Quinquatrus, is a festival in honor of Minerva that falls on the fifth day after the
  </p>
  <p>
   ides; the Compitalia is a festival in honor of the Lares, the gods of the hearth.
  </p>
  <p>
   394
  </p>
  <p>
   Without delay, Gallonius entered the kitchen, prepared and garnished the banquet, and
  </p>
  <p>
   carried it out to the table. The dynast washed his hands, took his seat, ate lunch, and
  </p>
  <p>
   once he had eaten he got up and withdrew to his room. We headed immediately to the
  </p>
  <p>
   senate house on the Capitoline where we came across the poliarchs holding court and
  </p>
  <p>
   immersed in the administration of justice. They were surrounded by fishmongers,
  </p>
  <p>
   innkeepers, cooks, sausage makers, confectioners, fishermen, and poultry sellers.
  </p>
  <p>
   There were so many of them that they would have overwhelmed the poliarchs had there
  </p>
  <p>
   not been a barrier in the way to protect them. The place was filled with a foul stench
  </p>
  <p>
   wafting from the tradespeople. Likewise, the din they made sounded like a stormy sea.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each one was saying something different: “Don’t impose a fine on me! Remove me from
  </p>
  <p>
   your register of offenders!” Another one was shouting: “Poliarchs, I will be distressed if
  </p>
  <p>
   you don’t help me!” This one gave false information; another one reminded a poliarch of
  </p>
  <p>
   their long-standing friendship; that one over there counted out money; and another one
  </p>
  <p>
   implored the faith of gods and men. Since it was a day for hearings, and the senate had
  </p>
  <p>
   to be called into session for the most important and serious matters, when the time
  </p>
  <p>
   came that the poliarchs had deliberated enough they announced: “Court adjourned!” All
  </p>
  <p>
   of the litigants left, having been released by the bailiff’s command.
  </p>
  <p>
   The poliarchs left the senate house and arrived at the curia where they were
  </p>
  <p>
   awaited by the buleutas (their word for senators) who were gathered in a big crowd. As
  </p>
  <p>
   the poliarchs entered, everyone stood up out of respect. Gallonius in particular was
  </p>
  <p>
   seized by a desire to know what important matter was driving this extraordinary session
  </p>
  <p>
   of the senate. He asked: “Are there enemies at the gates?” They responded that they
  </p>
  <p>
   needed to set the price of pickled salt fish because Fortune had carried a ship full of it to
  </p>
  <p>
   395
  </p>
  <p>
   their shores two days earlier.143 Next they had to decree how many pears and plums
  </p>
  <p>
   should be sold for one obol. After the buleutas had taken their seats one of the
  </p>
  <p>
   poliarchs, who was older than the others, moved the following resolution,144 that, if it
  </p>
  <p>
   pleased the conscript fathers, a pound of pickled salt fish should not be sold for more
  </p>
  <p>
   than one nummus. He declared that the price of fish had fallen, and he presented the
  </p>
  <p>
   example of the fishmongers’ unreasonable demands, who sold at a very steep price
  </p>
  <p>
   what they themselves purchased very cheaply. It was the greatest desire of the
  </p>
  <p>
   senators to pass a senatusconsultum145 in response to the poliarch’s words. Thus, they
  </p>
  <p>
   made an official declaration that a fishmonger, if he himself had purchased a pound of
  </p>
  <p>
   salt fish for less than an as and a half, was not allowed to resell it for more than a
  </p>
  <p>
   nummus. But they were not able to reach any decisions that day, both because it was
  </p>
  <p>
   late and because those scoundrels had found people to run out the clock by orating.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the poliarchs were talking among themselves after the senate had been
  </p>
  <p>
   adjourned, a man rushed in announcing that their lunch was getting cold. He advised
  </p>
  <p>
   them to hurry up and take their place at the table, because the day was already half
  </p>
  <p>
   gone. “He’s right,” said one of the poliarchs. “Let’s go.” While he was hurrying off to
  </p>
  <p>
   lunch he spotted Gallonius in the crowd. “Hello there!” he said. “I would like you, and
  </p>
  <p>
   those two men with you, to join us today.” “No thank you,” replied Gallonius, using his
  </p>
  <p>
   143 In this fictional account, these price-setting duties are being carried out in the senate, but in Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   time the standardization of prices, weights, and measures would have been performed by civic
  </p>
  <p>
   administrators in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Palace of Conservators), one of the palaces on the
  </p>
  <p>
   Capitoline Hill. The civic government set and oversaw these standards to regulate the marketplace and
  </p>
  <p>
   protect buyers from being taken advantage of (Nussdorfer 1992: 71-74; 119-127).
  </p>
  <p>
   144 My translation “moved the following resolution” for the Latin “facit mentionem placere statui” is from the
  </p>
  <p>
   translation of Cic. Ver. II.II. XXXIX.95 in Cicero and Greenwood 1928.
  </p>
  <p>
   145 A decree of the senate.
  </p>
  <p>
   396
  </p>
  <p>
   various responsibilities as an excuse. The poliarch replied: “Stop talking nonsense. If
  </p>
  <p>
   you dare speak another word, by the authority of my office, I will order you to be
  </p>
  <p>
   shackled and thrown in jail.” Gallonius looked at us smiling and said: “We must obey,
  </p>
  <p>
   unless we’d rather be taken into custody.” I replied: “I will always prefer a dining couch
  </p>
  <p>
   to jail and banquets to chains. Do as you please.” He said: “I also think it is preferable to
  </p>
  <p>
   be tied to a full table with chains of food than to wear thick shackles in jail.”
  </p>
  <p>
   We followed as he went ahead and were led into a room that was large and
  </p>
  <p>
   bright with beautiful paneling, bedecked with tapestries, and decorated with images that
  </p>
  <p>
   were hung around the room in a delightful and elegant manner. In the middle was an
  </p>
  <p>
   amply and magnificently upholstered dining couch. Set apart from that stood a
  </p>
  <p>
   sideboard full of objects. There was no pottery to be found; everything was made of
  </p>
  <p>
   silver: wash-basins, flasks, dishes, vessels for wine and salt, and cups. Many servants
  </p>
  <p>
   (they call them pistes146) dressed in purple and gold uniforms were running around
  </p>
  <p>
   carrying ice water for our hands. We washed our hands and, when ordered to do so,
  </p>
  <p>
   climbed up on our dining couches. The poliarchs were positioned at the head of the
  </p>
  <p>
   table, we on the far end, and the rest of the diners in the middle. The table was kept
  </p>
  <p>
   constantly filled with food. They brought in birds, sausages, fish, sweetbreads, and any
  </p>
  <p>
   other luxury that was in season. When lunch was starting to wrap up, the oldest poliarch
  </p>
  <p>
   said, almost angrily: “My mouth is watering with thirst. I’ve been sitting here parched for
  </p>
  <p>
   too long. Someone bring me a glass, and quickly!” The servants ran and fetched him
  </p>
  <p>
   one. When he brought the glass to his lips the poliarch exclaimed: “By god, this isn’t
  </p>
  <p>
   wine, it’s the very nectar of Jove himself! Where did it come from? What god sent this
  </p>
  <p>
   146 Pistes: “trusted ones,” from the Greek word πίστις.
  </p>
  <p>
   397
  </p>
  <p>
   wine down to us from the tables of the heaven dwellers?” The servant boy waiting on
  </p>
  <p>
   him replied: “It was sent to you today as a gift.” “By whom? Who has the financial
  </p>
  <p>
   wherewithal to send me such a gift?” “It was that tavern owner, the one who sank so
  </p>
  <p>
   deep into fraud that he sold mixed wine in place of unmixed.” The poliarch replied:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Such a great man. A man who produces an excellent drink like this, that could prolong
  </p>
  <p>
   a man’s life, should be acquitted rather than charged on so insignificant an infraction!
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, if this happiness could last forever, I should hope to prolong my life by two
  </p>
  <p>
   hundred years with this here wine.” He immediately called for larger wine glasses and
  </p>
  <p>
   ordered them to be distributed as soon as they were brought in.
  </p>
  <p>
   Iberus the scholar was seated near me, who (as we said before) was a refined
  </p>
  <p>
   and courteous man. While he was endlessly praising the unmixed wine and greedily
  </p>
  <p>
   guzzling it down his capacious gullet, a portion of the catfish that was set before him on
  </p>
  <p>
   a platter flew off, ran with its arms pumping, and took up a new residence. Coming to
  </p>
  <p>
   his senses and thinking this had happened through a trick of the pistes (which was the
  </p>
  <p>
   truth), Iberus exclaimed: “These types here deserve a beating. Where in the world are
  </p>
  <p>
   we? Are we living among the Lacedaemonians or the Cilices?147 Return what you have
  </p>
  <p>
   stolen from me! Bring back my piece of catfish!” The banqueters laughed, the poliarchs
  </p>
  <p>
   consoled their friend, and, in order to prevent him from inciting a riot, they each gave
  </p>
  <p>
   him their portion. He quieted down, his anger resolving into calm. Since they were
  </p>
  <p>
   drinking so often, which happened almost between each bite, Iberus defended himself
  </p>
  <p>
   against the dish thieves in the following way: He grabbed a tankard in one hand and
  </p>
  <p>
   plundered a dish with the other. It was useless to mount a smaller defense against the
  </p>
  <p>
   147 People from Sparta and Cilicia, respectively (i.e., barbarians).
  </p>
  <p>
   398
  </p>
  <p>
   ever-present tricks of so many vultures.148 You had to remain vigilant and keep your
  </p>
  <p>
   guard up. Some appealing side dish would barely be placed on the table when it
  </p>
  <p>
   disappeared from view; someone would take his eye or his hand off a dish for a second
  </p>
  <p>
   when some kite or hawk would catch sight of the treat. As a result, you would have
  </p>
  <p>
   thought that, instead of lunch, a feast in honor of Hecate was taking place.149
  </p>
  <p>
   After the meal, ten musicians entered and began playing their flutes most
  </p>
  <p>
   excellently. The entire hall resounded with the sound of beautiful music, and my ears
  </p>
  <p>
   had never before heard anything sweeter. But Iberus, who was feeling duped on
  </p>
  <p>
   account of the catfish, said: “These musicians are making us all go deaf. I’ve been
  </p>
  <p>
   calling for a drink for ages, and no one can hear me. Get them out of here! We don’t
  </p>
  <p>
   need any music.” “Agreed,” said the poliarchs. “Get out of our sight, fetch pitchers in
  </p>
  <p>
   place of pipes, and quickly fill your cheeks with wine instead of with your breath, as you
  </p>
  <p>
   have been doing up to now.” The musicians attacked, grabbed the wine bottles with no
  </p>
  <p>
   less speed than when earth falls downward or flames rush upward, and tipped the
  </p>
  <p>
   bottles upside down into their mouths, or rather, they poured them into an abyss.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the musicians were out of sight, Iberus asked whether the innkeeper, who
  </p>
  <p>
   had served them such good wine, frequently committed wrongdoing. “Very often,”
  </p>
  <p>
   replied the poliarchs. “No hawk or kite has ever managed to free itself from a snare in
  </p>
  <p>
   148 Rossi refers to birds here (the Latin is alitum) and a bit further on he mentions a kite and a hawk, but
  </p>
  <p>
   these are also metaphors for thieving people, in this case the servants who are hovering around the table
  </p>
  <p>
   and stealing food. For kites and hawks as metaphors for rapacious people see this definition in L&amp;S citing
  </p>
  <p>
   Plaut. Poen. V.v.1292: “male ego metuo milvos”; and Plaut. Pers. III.ii.408-9: “labes popli / pecuniai
  </p>
  <p>
   accipiter”).
  </p>
  <p>
   149 A sinister divinity associated with magic and witchcraft. In Hesiod's Theogony she is the
  </p>
  <p>
   granddaughter of the Titans Phoebe and Coeus, daughter of Perses and Asteria, and first cousin of
  </p>
  <p>
   Apollo and Artemis. She often identified with Diana, Luna, and Proserpina, and is therefore represented
  </p>
  <p>
   with three heads.
  </p>
  <p>
   399
  </p>
  <p>
   which it has become entangled more often than that innkeeper has been able to break
  </p>
  <p>
   free of every judicial sentence and law. Even if we were to decide to give him the
  </p>
  <p>
   maximum sentence, the dynasts would not allow us to do so because he has bound
  </p>
  <p>
   most of them to himself through some favor or other. He stocked a wine cellar for some,
  </p>
  <p>
   and for others he procures drink on a daily basis. Therefore, the dynasts compete with
  </p>
  <p>
   each other, as necessary, over providing for his security and well-being, the same way
  </p>
  <p>
   they would compete for their own glory, fortunes, and fame. But we benefit from his
  </p>
  <p>
   dishonesty as well. We can always get something out of that innkeeper whether it’s
  </p>
  <p>
   money, wine, or at least some delicate morsel.” There was some Greek man among
  </p>
  <p>
   them, put ashore here in a shipwreck as we had been, who, after drinking his fill of wine,
  </p>
  <p>
   tossed the remainder out of his glass so it made a splash. Iberus was indignant and
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “Is it your view that this wine deserves to be tossed out? If I had any wine left over
  </p>
  <p>
   to splash on the ground, it would be because someone was forcing me to drink an
  </p>
  <p>
   inferior or insipid kind. But I wouldn’t tolerate even one drop of wine this sweet going to
  </p>
  <p>
   waste.” And in one fell swoop, he filled an enormous bowl with unmixed wine just as
  </p>
  <p>
   when it had come from the mother vine. When he had finished he proceeded to lick
  </p>
  <p>
   whatever remained stuck to his scruffy mane with his tongue. On this account, the entire
  </p>
  <p>
   dinner party overflowed with fun and games.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the meal was over, the steward approached the poliarchs and asked if
  </p>
  <p>
   they might give him their attention for a moment, if it was no bother, because he had a
  </p>
  <p>
   very important matter he had to make them aware of as soon as possible. When asked
  </p>
  <p>
   what he had to say, he told them, in front all of us, that there were no scrub brushes left
  </p>
  <p>
   in the kitchen for washing the pots and pans. They had partly been consumed by use,
  </p>
  <p>
   400
  </p>
  <p>
   and partly been gnawed on by mice because they were so greasy. Then he wanted
  </p>
  <p>
   them to give him some money to buy new ones. The poliarchs replied that the matter
  </p>
  <p>
   was too important for them to make any decision, and also that a determination
  </p>
  <p>
   regarding a withdrawal of funds from the public treasury was not up to them but to the
  </p>
  <p>
   entire senate. They said that, out of regard for him, they would call a meeting of the
  </p>
  <p>
   senate forthwith, and that they would see to it that such a pressing matter was brought
  </p>
  <p>
   before that body as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the banquet was finished, everyone went back to his room to get some
  </p>
  <p>
   rest. We turned our eyes and our attention to viewing the paintings and the beautiful
  </p>
  <p>
   statues. Because we could not get enough, we spent four hours contemplating them
  </p>
  <p>
   and left when the day had turned into evening. While we were exiting, we grilled
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius on why he had not immediately rushed to take part in such a splendid
  </p>
  <p>
   luncheon, seeing as he had been invited to it, but had instead resorted to being dragged
  </p>
  <p>
   to it with force and threats. “Because,” he replied, “I was ashamed to be seen dining
  </p>
  <p>
   with men like that.” “What?” I said: “Isn’t that a respectable place of honor?” “The place
  </p>
  <p>
   is respectable,” he said, “but sometimes the men who go there are not. These days
  </p>
  <p>
   sculptors, painters, tailors, and (if it pleases the gods) common laborers come to the
  </p>
  <p>
   luncheon after securing the right to attend by favors or for a price. Because of this, there
  </p>
  <p>
   are hardly any noblemen who seek this office, except for a few who have been cleaned
  </p>
  <p>
   out of their wealth. On the contrary, many willingly recuse themselves from it.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While we were talking, the scholar Aridus bumped into us and we came to a stop.
  </p>
  <p>
   He asked Gallonius where he was coming from and where he was heading. Gallonius
  </p>
  <p>
   responded: “We have just left the senate house.” “What business did you have in the
  </p>
  <p>
   401
  </p>
  <p>
   senate? Were you called there on behalf of some innkeeper or confectioner?” “No,”
  </p>
  <p>
   responded Gallonius, “we were invited there for lunch and forced to go by Poliarch
  </p>
  <p>
   Euclio, the son of his fuller Megadorus.”150 “I understand,” Aridus answered. “Did you
  </p>
  <p>
   enjoy good wine and fine food?” “Indeed,” replied Gallonius, “I have never had better in
  </p>
  <p>
   my life.” “I am glad it turned out well for you,” said Aridus. “Where are you going?” asked
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius. “I don’t know where I’m going, or what I’m doing,” said Aridus. “I could barely
  </p>
  <p>
   tear myself away from a man who was clinging to my side and refused to let go. I was
  </p>
  <p>
   leaving the Temple of Apollo, where I often go to pray, and this well-dressed old man
  </p>
  <p>
   came across my path. He greeted me and I returned his greeting. Then he said:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Though you have not enjoyed my acquaintance before now, and perhaps you have
  </p>
  <p>
   never met me, nevertheless I cherish your virtues and desire your friendship.’ I thanked
  </p>
  <p>
   him and assured him that there was nothing in my mediocre intellect or fortune that he
  </p>
  <p>
   should admire and look up to (and I did not even dare ask who he was). But he said: ‘If
  </p>
  <p>
   you knew me, you would know that I am most certainly an upstanding man and, most
  </p>
  <p>
   importantly, I value a good reputation. And you will not find anyone else of my station or
  </p>
  <p>
   rank equally desirous of a good name, or who has a wife and children more renowned
  </p>
  <p>
   for their reputation of modesty. What is more, you should know that I would rather
  </p>
  <p>
   sacrifice my life and all of my money than allow any blemish, even a small one, to
  </p>
  <p>
   tarnish my reputation. What need would I have for life, what need for riches and wealth,
  </p>
  <p>
   if any part of my good name were lost? Besides, every eighth day I bathe myself in a
  </p>
  <p>
   purifying river and sacrifice a lamb to the gods. But my son is confounding my plans,

  <p>
   showing me less deference than is proper to show a father. A few days ago, in hand-to-
  </p>
  <p>
   hand combat, he pierced his rival with a sword and sent him to Orcus. He is currently
  </p>
  <p>
   living in exile, but he will soon be allowed to return; that’s what that man in charge of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Republic promised. Though he is prone to anger, he excels in looks and in many
  </p>
  <p>
   praiseworthy virtues. And since he is not more than twenty years old, he is thoroughly
  </p>
  <p>
   charming and handsome from his hair down to his toenails. He fears no competitor his
  </p>
  <p>
   same age in sword fighting or on horseback. Moreover, he sings in a manner that
  </p>
  <p>
   makes even Apollo envious.’
  </p>
  <p>
   “At that point I said: ‘Gosh, that is quite a fine young man you are describing.
  </p>
  <p>
   What a happy mother is she who has given birth to such a son. What should I say the
  </p>
  <p>
   boy’s name is?’ ‘Pusillus Pleurae,’151 he replied. ‘Can I ask, is he married?’ ‘May the
  </p>
  <p>
   gods prevent it!’ he said. ‘At least that is one less worry he will burden me with. But he
  </p>
  <p>
   does have a sister. She married a young man who, above all, is handsome and loved
  </p>
  <p>
   by all of the leading men. Besides her appearance (you have likely heard of her beauty),
  </p>
  <p>
   she plays the flute excellently and matches her voice to the sound of flutes so
  </p>
  <p>
   beautifully that she could draw even Jove himself down from the heavens. Because of
  </p>
  <p>
   this there were such throngs of important men coming to hear her that, since my house
  </p>
  <p>
   could not accommodate their size and number, I needed to rent a much larger palace in
  </p>
  <p>
   the most exclusive part of the city. Yesterday I paid eight minae for a six-month rental of
  </p>
  <p>
   that house. Not surprisingly, everyone was eager to hear my daughter. They had not
  </p>
  <p>
   heard her for a long time, since we had only just now returned from visiting King

  <p>
   and fears the gods. I care only for her because she takes care of me and clothes and
  </p>
  <p>
   dresses me quite finely. But as to how her estate, which is very meager, can sustain
  </p>
  <p>
   such expense, I do not think that is for an upstanding father to investigate.’ When I
  </p>
  <p>
   heard this I finally understood this man to be the father of the famous courtesan

  <p>
   Pleura.152 Seized with a sense of shame greater than I could possibly describe—and
  </p>
  <p>
   fearing that I would be seen walking with him on the street—I tore myself away from his
  </p>
  <p>
   side by lying and making excuses, and I escaped from that disgrace.” “Well, what do
  </p>
  <p>
   you know!” said Gallonius. “Yet another type of goat I had forgotten about; the kind who,
  </p>
  <p>
   although he is the lowest of the low, strives to ingratiate himself into other people’s
  </p>
  <p>
   esteem by feigning honor and virtue. But the impudence of such a man is even more

  <p>
   intolerable because he tries to obscure the most manifest and clear matters by insisting

   152 Margherita Costa (1600-1664) was a virtuosa singer, performer, and writer who frequented the salons
  </p>
  <p>
   of Urban VIII’s Rome. Her work Li buffoni (Florence: Massi e Landi, 1641) was the first printed comedy by
  </p>
  <p>
   a woman (Cox 2011: 92). I translate the Latin word meretrix here as “courtesan,” whereas elsewhere I
  </p>
  <p>
   translate it as “prostitute” or “whore” (for example in reference to the character Nanna in Book Two). The
  </p>
  <p>
   courtesans (or virtuose) of early modern Italy, whose singing and recitations were an integral part of the
  </p>
  <p>
   entertainment of courtly life, “persisted as one of the great tourist attractions” of urban centers such as
  </p>
  <p>
   Rome and Venice (Cohen 1991: 201-2). The characterization of these female performers as prostitutes is
  </p>
  <p>
   frequently found in the contemporary writings of men in elite academic circles where such descriptions
  </p>
  <p>
   functioned as a “kind of ‘society game’ usefully facilitating relations among men” (Cox 2008: 193, as
  </p>
  <p>
   quoted in Brosius 2009: 17). Rossi himself, for example, offers the following description of Margherita
  </p>
  <p>
   Costa in his Pinacotheca (1729: 694): “Margarita Costa, non magis canendi artificio, quam turpi quaestu
  </p>
  <p>
   famosa” (“Margherita Costa was famous not so much for her skill in singing as for her dishonorable
  </p>
  <p>
   profession”). On the other hand, the virtuose performers of early modern courtly society were expected to
  </p>
  <p>
   have sex with their elite patrons should they be asked to do so (Brosius 2009: 31-2). Cohen (1991: 201-2)
  </p>
  <p>
   stresses that the rhetorical distinction between sophisticated “courtesans” and lowly “prostitutes” or
  </p>
  <p>
   “whores” is one that has been retrospectively imposed by the prejudices of later scholars who, while
  </p>
  <p>
   examining the status of the women who moved in the elite courtly circles of early modern Italy, “have tried
  </p>
  <p>
   to deal with the ambiguity of the prostitute’s complex role by highlighting one dimension and implicitly
  </p>
  <p>
   denying another.” Giachino (2002: 213, n. 76) identifies Pleura as either Francesca Caccini (known as “La
  </p>
  <p>
   Cecchina”) or Leonora Baroni—both virtuose singers, instrumentalists, and composers—but the
  </p>
  <p>
   identification as Margherita Costa is the most plausible one given pseudonym’s derivation from the Greek
  </p>
  <p>
   word πλευρά (costa in Latin, or rib in English).

   that it is dark at high noon. He was openly lying about his daughter being summoned to
  </p>
  <p>
   marry King Anthimus. She had been brought there by a young man who had her on
  </p>
  <p>
   loan, but she was tossed out as far as possible from the borders of his kingdom—on
  </p>
  <p>
   account of the scandals and chaos she caused—and she made her way back to her
  </p>
  <p>
   homeland.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “But enough about that,” said Aridus. “Has any word reached you about Lyco153
  </p>
  <p>
   the banker running away?” “Nothing,” replied Gallonius. “But what’s this I hear? Lyco
  </p>
  <p>
   the banker did what wicked slaves are wont to do?154 If what you say is true, those ten
  </p>
  <p>
   minae that I deposited at his bank yesterday have most certainly disappeared.” “Cheer
  </p>
  <p>
   up,” said Aridus. “You have this misfortune in common with many others. Yesterday,
  </p>
  <p>
   from sunup to sundown, he never stopped accepting deposits of silver that were
  </p>
  <p>
   brought to him; paying out to everyone what he had taken on deposit; not recording
  </p>
  <p>
   anyone’s account as paid; and making excuses to those who brought him promissory
  </p>
  <p>
   notes for money that had been sent to them, saying he was too busy and asking them
  </p>
  <p>
   to come back the next day. Flush with cash because of this, he fled in the dead of night,
  </p>
  <p>
   or rather, he hid himself in the palace of some powerful man, whose protection he
  </p>
  <p>
   enjoyed, in order to stash the money he had stolen in a safe place. Among the many
  </p>
  <p>
   153 Lyco is the name of a banker (“Lyco trapezita”) in Plaut. Curc. This story about Lyco the banker, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the following story about Harpax the cloth merchant, are replete with technical terminology about credit,
  </p>
  <p>
   debt, collateral, and promissory documents, reflecting Rossi’s own early-career training in contract law
  </p>
  <p>
   under the mentorship of the renowned Sienese lawyer Lepido Piccolomini. In a 1632 letter to Guilelmus
  </p>
  <p>
   Moonsius he recounts that he trained in contract (i.e., private) law rather than criminal law: “reos autem
  </p>
  <p>
   dico, non eos qui causam capitis dicunt, sed quorum res est unde et reus stipulandi et reus promettendi,
  </p>
  <p>
   reus debendi, et reus credendi, reus satisdandi et reus accipiendi” (“I am not talking about those involved
  </p>
  <p>
   in capital crimes but those whose cases have to do with creditors and debtors” (stipulandi/promettendi,
  </p>
  <p>
   debendi/credendi, satisdandi/accipiendi are all different ways in Roman law of expressing creditors and
  </p>
  <p>
   debtors).
  </p>
  <p>
   154 The runaway slave is a frequent trope in ancient literature, and instances of fugitive slaves are well
  </p>
  <p>
   attested in documentary evidence (Bradley 1994: 118-121).
  </p>
  <p>
   405
  </p>
  <p>
   people who had been dashed against this rock there were a great many honest
  </p>
  <p>
   maidens and widows who, in order to protect their dowries (the only defense they have
  </p>
  <p>
   of their modesty and against a life of solitude) from thieving relatives, deposited them
  </p>
  <p>
   with this crooked banker where they were wantonly plundered. What a horrible man,
  </p>
  <p>
   and one deserving of crucifixion and hanging! In any case, let’s hope that Lyco is found
  </p>
  <p>
   to be like Harpax155 who added his name to the bankrupts last year. It would not turn out
  </p>
  <p>
   so badly for the creditors!”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Who is Harpax?” I asked. “He is that well-known cloth merchant who had that
  </p>
  <p>
   draper’s shop at the bottom of Janus’s Exchange where he spent his youth. Four years
  </p>
  <p>
   ago, when he got tired of working, he was overcome by a great desire to declare
  </p>
  <p>
   bankruptcy, even though his business was still whole, indeed flourishing. He didn’t lose
  </p>
  <p>
   anything in a shipwreck, none of his merchandise was destroyed in a fire, and there
  </p>
  <p>
   were no extraordinary expenditures causing him to run up a large debt. On the contrary,
  </p>
  <p>
   everything always proceeded according to plan and, thanks to a life lived with difficulty
  </p>
  <p>
   and sparingly, his various business interests amassed money and resources. Do you
  </p>
  <p>
   need proof of this man’s frugality? Here it is: He never threw away any used piece of
  </p>
  <p>
   paper,156 but instead he diligently collected them and saved them to use as envelopes
  </p>
  <p>
   for letters that he sent to others. He never cut the twine that bundles of letters sent to
  </p>
  <p>
   him were bound with, but instead he untied them and put them to other uses. I could
  </p>
  <p>
   155 Harpax is the name of a character in Plaut. Pseud.
  </p>
  <p>
   156 The Latin word given here is opistographum, a parchment or papyrus that has text written on both
  </p>
  <p>
   sides. The significance of that word choice in the context of the man’s parsimony is that, if a sheet of
  </p>
  <p>
   paper or parchment is only written on one side, it could be reused to write something on the clean side. If
  </p>
  <p>
   it is written on both sides, however, it is no longer useful, and therefore, presumably, most people would
  </p>
  <p>
   throw it away. The pannarius is so cheap that he nonetheless succeeds in finding a use for it.
  </p>
  <p>
   406
  </p>
  <p>
   give you a million157 examples, if I had the time. One day, after lunch, this man, being so
  </p>
  <p>
   frugal, summoned his sister’s son to his house, whom he had been supporting. He
  </p>
  <p>
   showed him how wonderful it was to abound in riches and told him that loyalty, honesty,
  </p>
  <p>
   and a good reputation were meaningless words. He informed his nephew that, to this
  </p>
  <p>
   day, he had never been able to use good esteem or reputation in place of cash at the
  </p>
  <p>
   bank or the butcher shop, and he had never seen anyone purchase fowl, fish, or any
  </p>
  <p>
   other delicacies at the store with such currency, but only with ready cash. He told him
  </p>
  <p>
   that he had sacrificed enough for his work and his business ventures; that he was now
  </p>
  <p>
   ready to spend his subsequent working life and years more agreeably; and that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   determined to lead a different sort of life that was, of course, charming, noble, pleasant,
  </p>
  <p>
   and filled with delights. But their own business was unable to provide for such expenses
  </p>
  <p>
   because it was not large enough. He informed his nephew that he had decided to seek
  </p>
  <p>
   the help of other people’s money; that is to say, he decided to enrich himself via the
  </p>
  <p>
   financial loss of others. He said: ‘It would be financially beneficial for us not to return the
  </p>
  <p>
   money we owe. Therefore, while I spend the afternoon napping in peace, you run over
  </p>
  <p>
   at full speed to the state treasurer’s office and, faking the loss of our merchandise and
  </p>
  <p>
   our ruin, pry out of him—with entreaties and tears—an official document, or an order
  </p>
  <p>
   that warns any creditors to leave us alone. I will take care of the rest. They shall sweat
  </p>
  <p>
   it, god willing, and it will not be difficult to obtain what we want, since we hold a lot of
  </p>
  <p>
   sway over the treasurer. This much I know: the theft will be manifest, odious, and
  </p>
  <p>
   157 The Latin is sexcenta, which is literally six hundred but is used to mean an innumerable amount, which
  </p>
  <p>
   is akin to “a million” in English.
  </p>
  <p>
   407
  </p>
  <p>
   shameful. Besides that, we will be the talk of the town. But what do I care? Do I have
  </p>
  <p>
   any control over what people say?’
  </p>
  <p>
   “When he had finished speaking, he gave himself completely over to sleep, his
  </p>
  <p>
   mind at ease. His nephew left to do as he had been instructed. He visited the treasurer
  </p>
  <p>
   and recounted how Harpax had been cleaned clear out of his possessions, and how he
  </p>
  <p>
   feared the savagery of his creditors. The wicked nephew carried out this deception with
  </p>
  <p>
   tears and with a confounded look on his face. Finally, he begged the treasurer to help
  </p>
  <p>
   his uncle. The treasurer, moved by the trust he had in the speaker, and also by a sense
  </p>
  <p>
   of pity, granted the nephew more than he could have hoped for. After he had
  </p>
  <p>
   successfully taken care of business, the nephew returned home rejoicing and found his
  </p>
  <p>
   uncle still snoring. His uncle was sound asleep, and he did not wish to wake him up.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead, he placed the written order against his uncle’s pillow and left the room. Harpax
  </p>
  <p>
   woke up, and, while he was yawning and stretching, he bumped his nose against the
  </p>
  <p>
   document that had been placed near his head. He picked it up, looked at it, read it, and
  </p>
  <p>
   exclaimed with joy: ‘I am rich!’ And to his sister’s son, who had come running when he
  </p>
  <p>
   heard his voice, he said: ‘Well done, young man! Beautiful! Quick thinking! Nicely done!
  </p>
  <p>
   Congratulations, now you are one of us! Because of your extraordinary sense of loyalty
  </p>
  <p>
   toward me, your uncle, you deserve to enjoy my riches with me equally, and even more
  </p>
  <p>
   so.’ Without delay, as is the way of those who squander other people’s money, he
  </p>
  <p>
   closed up his shop and proceeded to act like someone who had declared bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In the meantime, the rumor about Harpax’s bankruptcy started to spread.
  </p>
  <p>
   Everyone thought it was astonishing, strange, and unbelievable that that man, who just
  </p>
  <p>
   four hours earlier had been in such great shape in terms of his wealth and reputation,
  </p>
  <p>
   408
  </p>
  <p>
   had been cleaned out of everything in the blink of an eye and had fallen into ruin. But he
  </p>
  <p>
   had no shortage of creditors. They rushed to the praetor’s office, told him what had
  </p>
  <p>
   happened, and successfully pleaded for Harpax to be taken off to jail. Lictors hurried to
  </p>
  <p>
   Harpax’s house, ran in, seized him, and tossed him into chains. He stuck the quaestor’s
  </p>
  <p>
   written order in the lictors’ faces, fended off their attack, shook their confidence, and,
  </p>
  <p>
   after mocking them shamelessly, told them and his creditors to go to hell. His creditors,
  </p>
  <p>
   when they saw that their plan had been foiled, got together, complained, consulted with
  </p>
  <p>
   each other, and sought the best course of action. But all of their plans fell flat and they
  </p>
  <p>
   could not figure out what to do.
  </p>
  <p>
   “While they were all in a rage, a man came forward who was in cahoots with
  </p>
  <p>
   Harpax (and had been secretly dispatched by him), and he pretended to have a large
  </p>
  <p>
   balance with Harpax. He said: ‘If you will permit me to give you advice, I will work out
  </p>
  <p>
   some sort of terms of agreement with him. Although he has a great deal of wealth, his
  </p>
  <p>
   mother nevertheless claims a significant part of it as her dowry, as does his sister’s son.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each of them surpasses our claim, both in the amount of money and in the length of
  </p>
  <p>
   time they have had a claim to it.’ None of the creditors doubted that this man would be
  </p>
  <p>
   able to work out an agreement with Harpax. They said that a partial repayment would
  </p>
  <p>
   be preferable to losing everything, and they assigned this man the task of going to
  </p>
  <p>
   Harpax, taking up their cause, and settling the matter with him with as little damage to
  </p>
  <p>
   themselves as possible. The man returned the next day and informed them that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   just barely persuaded Harpax to pay half of what he owed to each creditor, within two
  </p>
  <p>
   years, and that he had gotten him to agree, with the greatest force, to offer up his
  </p>
  <p>
   mother and his sister’s son as collateral for what he had promised. They all cried out:
  </p>
  <p>
   409
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘What audacity! What impertinence!’ What could be a more impudent proposal than
  </p>
  <p>
   agreeing to have only half of what is owed to you returned, and, adding insult to injury,
  </p>
  <p>
   to have to beg for that amount to be portioned out over two years? The man who had
  </p>
  <p>
   reported back to them said: ‘Do as you please; his mother’s and his sister’s son’s debt
  </p>
  <p>
   has surely depleted his resources. As far as I am concerned, I am definitely set on
  </p>
  <p>
   coming to an agreement with him.’ After their anger had calmed down, the poor
  </p>
  <p>
   creditors realized that they were caught between a rock and a hard place. They
  </p>
  <p>
   unanimously decided to submit to Fortune and to accept the deal that was on the table.
  </p>
  <p>
   They made their decision based on the word of the man who had proposed the
  </p>
  <p>
   agreement, and to that end they all consented to it in writing.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Harpax, who had just been enriched by such a recent windfall, rented a
  </p>
  <p>
   magnificent villa on Janus Hill at great expense (a beautiful place far removed from
  </p>
  <p>
   onlookers), along with its adjoining gardens.158 He acquired a carriage, servants for his
  </p>
  <p>
   household, and he hosted sumptuous and splendid feasts on a daily basis. In order to
  </p>
  <p>
   redeem himself in people’s estimation via some deception, and in order to make it
  </p>
  <p>
   appear as if he had lost all of his possessions due not to his own mistakes but to
  </p>
  <p>
   Fortune, he visited the temples of the immortal gods. Praying at all their altars on his
  </p>
  <p>
   knees he cried”:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Father Janus,” with loud voice “Apollo,” then moves his lips, fearing to be
  </p>
  <p>
   heard: “Fair Laverna, grant me to escape detection; grant me to pass as
  </p>
  <p>
   just and upright, shroud my sins in night, my lies in clouds!”159

   When Aridus had finished speaking, everyone fell silent. After a short time
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius, as if awakened out of a sleep, either shaken by the pain of his shipwrecked—
  </p>
  <p>
   or rather his sunk-to-the-bottom—money, or driven mad with rage, said: “These thieves
  </p>
  <p>
   and robbers who get caught red-handed, if it were up to me, they’d all be hanged! Why
  </p>
  <p>
   is it my fate that, for the last three years, no one has gone bankrupt without throwing my

  <p>
   own fortunes into chaos? Did not Pleusides,160 who went into banking two years ago,

   also pull a fast one on me? He robbed me of four minae.” “He didn’t fool me,” said
  </p>
  <p>
   Aridus. “When you look at his face, his very head and eyebrows seem to reek of the
  </p>
  <p>
   cross and cry out for the fork,161 don’t they?” Gallonius followed up: “But he did it with
  </p>
  <p>
   such elegance! Before he laid a hand on anyone’s money, keeping it secret from
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone, he had it recorded in the public record that he had no place on earth to call
  </p>
  <p>
   his own; and that everything which was thought to be his actually belonged to his uncle
  </p>
  <p>
   and his aunt. At that point, he began taking money from everyone and trading it. Finally,
  </p>
  <p>
   loaded up with cash, he pulled up stakes and went to the next kingdom over from this
  </p>
  <p>
   island, in order to swindle more people out of their money. I hear that he has
  </p>
  <p>
   established a new bank there, that is to say, a new mechanism for plundering.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Aridus said: “Why don’t you also tell this man about the theft of Septimus
  </p>
  <p>
   Pleusippus, the most shameless of all of the thieves we have been discussing. Is it
  </p>
  <p>
   perhaps because you managed to escape from him unharmed and didn’t lose your shirt
  </p>
  <p>
   along with the others?” “My god, I had forgotten about him. There are so many of those
  </p>
  <p>
   160 Name of a character in Plaut. Mil.
  </p>
  <p>
   161 The cross (crux) and the fork (furca) are two forms of punishment for thieves and criminals. The former
  </p>
  <p>
   is the most severe where the criminal is nailed to a wooden structure in the shape of a cross. The latter is
  </p>
  <p>
   a piece of wood in the shape of a letter A, which was placed on the shoulders and around the neck of the
  </p>
  <p>
   offender, whose hands were tied to it. (L&amp;S; Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquites).
  </p>
  <p>
   411
  </p>
  <p>
   thieves around that it’s no wonder the sheer number of them makes me unable to
  </p>
  <p>
   remember any specific one. But please, you tell the story. My anger, which causes me
  </p>
  <p>
   great distress, has almost driven me mad.” “Gladly,” Aridus replied. “This Septimus,
  </p>
  <p>
   whom we mentioned, suddenly dissolved the bank that he had been managing for many
  </p>
  <p>
   years. He ordered his son—to whom he had cunningly granted independence162—to
  </p>
  <p>
   start up a new bank and to buy off of him the funds which he had out in notes, which
  </p>
  <p>
   were very great and owed by people who were insolvent. The son did as he was told.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a newly-established banker, he took money from everyone, which he signed over to
  </p>
  <p>
   his father as rightful payment of the notes he had bought. His father, after it seemed that
  </p>
  <p>
   he had satisfactorily made his family estate whole, called his son and said: ‘Son, we
  </p>
  <p>
   have done enough to satisfy our obligations. We have satisfactorily taken care of our
  </p>
  <p>
   family estate, and Laverna has been sufficiently on our side. It did not make me happy
  </p>
  <p>
   to see our estate almost fall into ruin on account of those dishonest debtors. Since I now
  </p>
  <p>
   see that our estate has returned to good order, I believe it is right to go easy on the
  </p>
  <p>
   funds of those poor innocent people. Just as I praise those who take care of their own
  </p>
  <p>
   estates, even when it involves injury to others, I likewise hate those who go too far and
  </p>
  <p>
   impose no limit on their thieving. For this reason, I think you should do what bankers
  </p>
  <p>
   often do, which is to discharge your debt by fleeing; that is, to hide yourself away in the
  </p>
  <p>
   house of some dynast, until such time as I am able satisfy your creditors with some sort
  </p>
  <p>
   162 The Latin phrase is “quem maliciose emancipaverat.” According to Roman law, sons remained under
  </p>
  <p>
   their father’s legal control (“patria potestas”) until their father’s death. This meant that a son did not exist
  </p>
  <p>
   as an independent legal entity and could not, for example, own any property of his own. A son could
  </p>
  <p>
   become independent while the father was still alive only via the legal process of emancipation
  </p>
  <p>
   (emancipatio) at which point he became “sui iuris.” The sense here is that Septimus needs his son to
  </p>
  <p>
   open his own bank in order to buy up his (the father’s) debts, so he schemes to emancipate him in order
  </p>
  <p>
   to make that possible under the law.
  </p>
  <p>
   412
  </p>
  <p>
   of settlement. It will be just as much my responsibility to see that you are permitted to
  </p>
  <p>
   show your face in public again as soon as possible.’
  </p>
  <p>
   “Septimus did not delay but immediately dispatched several people to spread the
  </p>
  <p>
   word that his son had become bankrupt. Hearing this news, the creditors rushed
  </p>
  <p>
   forward, besieged his house, made a list of his possessions, and put a seal on the
  </p>
  <p>
   records.163 Septimus came upon them while they were at this and said: ‘What does my
  </p>
  <p>
   household owe you?’ ‘You’ll soon find out,’ they responded. ‘Walk to court!’164 Septimus
  </p>
  <p>
   willingly obeyed, approached the praetor, demonstrated that his emancipated son was
  </p>
  <p>
   responsible for managing his own affairs, and that the matter had nothing to do with
  </p>
  <p>
   him. Thus, he was sent away a free man, and the creditors went away crestfallen. But
  </p>
  <p>
   the beloved father, mindful of his promise, made a deal with the creditors regarding his
  </p>
  <p>
   son’s return. He gathered them together and proposed taking steps by which the
  </p>
  <p>
   majority of the debt that he owed the poor creditors would be dissolved. Those who
  </p>
  <p>
   thought they had completely lost their money seized upon what little they were able to
  </p>
  <p>
   walk away with, as if it had been sent down from heaven. But instances of good fortune
  </p>
  <p>
   hardly ever occur alone, but they arise joined together in pairs. Septimus was so
  </p>
  <p>
   successful in his thieving that he turned the unsecured notes, which he had sold to his
  </p>
  <p>
   son, into good cash. From those who owed him, he exacted the entire amount. Many of
  </p>
  <p>
   163 Placing a seal on the house or effects of someone accused of theft was a way for an accuser to
  </p>
  <p>
   prevent the removal of the stolen goods, which he needed both as evidence of the theft and because he
  </p>
  <p>
   wanted to get them back (Cicero and Yonge 1903).
  </p>
  <p>
   164 The Latin is ambula in jus. That a defendant must go to court when called is the first law of the Twelve
  </p>
  <p>
   Tables: “Si in ius vocat, ito, ni it, antestamino; igitur em capito” (“If a plaintiff summons a defendant to
  </p>
  <p>
   court, he shall go. If he does not go, plaintiff shall call witness thereto. Then only shall he take defendant
  </p>
  <p>
   by force”). An example of this in Roman literature can be found, among other examples, in Plaut. Pers.
  </p>
  <p>
   IV.ix.745, in which Saturio orders the leno to walk to court.
  </p>
  <p>
   413
  </p>
  <p>
   his guarantors pleaded vigorously and swore oaths as to their insolvency to get him to
  </p>
  <p>
   forgive their debt even by one as.
  </p>
  <p>
   “One difficulty remained that tormented Septimus’s son, who was desirous of a
  </p>
  <p>
   good reputation, and that was the dishonor and disgrace that he had attached to
  </p>
  <p>
   himself. He asked: ‘Will I ever be able to look my fellow citizens in the eye or show my
  </p>
  <p>
   face to my people?’ To which the young man’s father responded: ‘Be quiet, you fool. In
  </p>
  <p>
   this town it is money that is respected, not one’s reputation. As long as your funds are
  </p>
  <p>
   intact, if you ever incur a stain on your reputation, it is easily washed away.’ But the son
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately replied: ‘Father, I believe I have discovered a way to recover my lost good
  </p>
  <p>
   name. There is a philosopher here from the Stoic school who enjoys a great reputation
  </p>
  <p>
   and renown among the people. During the public assemblies he holds on feast days, he
  </p>
  <p>
   inveighs against the luxury and greed of our citizens. Everyone admires him as if he
  </p>
  <p>
   were descended from heaven. I am set on following this man and on joining myself to
  </p>
  <p>
   him in close association. In this way, I can hide whatever wrongdoing I commit behind
  </p>
  <p>
   his uprightness.’ His father approved of this plan, so the son devoted himself to this
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher, clung to his side, sat next to him while he was addressing the crowds,
  </p>
  <p>
   guarded his cloak, and carried his handkerchief which he used to wipe away the
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher’s perspiration. While he wanted to hide, however, he ended up exposing
  </p>
  <p>
   himself; while he strove to heal the wounds of his dishonor, he made them worse,
  </p>
  <p>
   because people became irritated and offended by such a rotten deception.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Following up on this story with sharp words, Aridus took his spectacles out of
  </p>
  <p>
   their case, placed them on his nose, and directed his gaze toward the top of the town
  </p>
  <p>
   square. Gallonius looked there as well and said: “Look, it’s Salvius Typhernas with
  </p>
  <p>
   414
  </p>
  <p>
   Lepidus Gallutius Sinister, son of Minutius. Aridus will immediately go over and praise
  </p>
  <p>
   Lepidus, and he will encourage him in his pursuit of virtue with his extemporaneous
  </p>
  <p>
   verses.” And Gallonius was not wrong; Aridus walked toward Lepidus and began thus:
  </p>
  <p>
   Farewell, propitious light of the Muses, noble progeny of the Sinister line;
  </p>
  <p>
   no lineage is more distinguished than yours, whether in regard to the piety
  </p>
  <p>
   of its men or the sheer number of its ancestors. Aridus greets you,
  </p>
  <p>
   burdened by old age, but burdened even more by the great weight of an
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient fault that has driven his soul, which had been striving upward,
  </p>
  <p>
   down toward the deepest depths. His persistent habit of sinning gives
  </p>
  <p>
   weakens a man’s strength in battle, should a fierce army of sins take up
  </p>
  <p>
   arms in combat. But even at your tender age you have a venerable mind
  </p>
  <p>
   that is beyond your years, a steadfast love of probity, and a desire for
  </p>
  <p>
   praise. Such beautiful wisdom feasts on its own nectar. What wonder is it
  </p>
  <p>
   that mad pleasure cannot make sport of him with false makeup or smear
  </p>
  <p>
   him with ugly mud? Hail to your soul! Hail to your mind! The lofty and
  </p>
  <p>
   celebrated virtue of great Hercules shines similarly. He found narrow
  </p>
  <p>
   paths preferable to wide ones and steep crags preferable to flowers and
  </p>
  <p>
   beautiful fields. That is to say, he placed harsh labor and hazardous war
  </p>
  <p>
   above wretched leisure and feather beds. Overcoming this, he struck
  </p>
  <p>
   down the fierce hydra in combat and subdued the fabled monsters with his
  </p>
  <p>
   fateful labor. He subdues and hobbles wild beasts with strong chains, and
  </p>
  <p>
   his noble courage finds nothing to be insurmountable. Young man,
  </p>
  <p>
   capable of a hundred noble arts and pliant as wet clay, you will imitate
  </p>
  <p>
   anything as long as your fertile mind has access to frequent cultivation. Do
  </p>
  <p>
   it quickly; do not delay. What joys will rise in you when your glory, with the
  </p>
  <p>
   swift wings of a bird, smites the lofty air and places you among the highest
  </p>
  <p>
   stars? In addition, what dire cohort, what savage troop of troubles may
  </p>
  <p>
   pass you by, what sad cares can be scattered from your whole heart,
  </p>
  <p>
   when you scorn and shrink from those things which lacerate the gloomy
  </p>
  <p>
   mind with burning spurs and infect it with marks that can be blotted out
  </p>
  <p>
   only with floods of tears? Oh, if only I—not slothful as I was before—were
  </p>
  <p>
   permitted to live my youth over again, committing my path to your
  </p>
  <p>
   footsteps. But, since the period of time past does not return, it remains for
  </p>
  <p>
   me to see you forge ahead at an unhindered pace, through the liberal arts,
  </p>
  <p>
   all the way to the heights of lofty renown; and, joined with a throng that
  </p>
  <p>
   hangs on your every word, I would offer you effusive applause from my
  </p>
  <p>
   joyful heart, whether a chorus of the Muses recites learned poems, or a
  </p>
  <p>
   thousand eyes admire you as you speak, or whether anyone assumes you
  </p>
  <p>
   as an advocate for their cases. In the meantime, pass on my greetings to
  </p>
  <p>
   your father and your brother. So that lasting pride come to your father from
  </p>
  <p>
   415
  </p>
  <p>
   your accomplishments, may Lachesis165 spin out her gold thread and let
  </p>
  <p>
   her not stop drawing out your distinguished life, with her fingers, in rich
  </p>
  <p>
   thread before your father reaches Nestor’s166 ripe old age.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aridus would never have stopped pouring forth verses into the wee hours if Gallutius,
  </p>
  <p>
   who perhaps had somewhere to be in a hurry, had not said goodbye and left. Aridus
  </p>
  <p>
   turned to Gallonius and said: “I am sorry I had to be the bearer of bad news.” “On the
  </p>
  <p>
   contrary,” said Gallonius, “I am grateful that you kept me informed. I just have to ask my
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast to send word to the praetor, for the sake of his reputation, that no injury befell me
  </p>
  <p>
   during Lyco’s trial. I do not doubt that, in exchange for the service I faithfully render to
  </p>
  <p>
   him, he will take up my protection.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Iberus, the man who, in the academy gathering, had expressed in four verses his
  </p>
  <p>
   method for maintaining his health throughout the summer, held us up as we were trying
  </p>
  <p>
   to leave. He was on his way back from the senate house where, besides his luncheon,
  </p>
  <p>
   he had extracted an afternoon snack from the poliarchs. I stayed willingly because I
  </p>
  <p>
   desired to make the acquaintance of this most charming man. We saw that he had two
  </p>
  <p>
   attendants dressed in black following him. Aridus asked which dearly departed he was
  </p>
  <p>
   mourning, whether it was perhaps his brother, his sister, or his paternal or maternal
  </p>
  <p>
   aunt. He responded: “I am mourning myself. I am dead.” “What are you talking about?”
  </p>
  <p>
   said Aridus. “Are you quite well? If this is the state of all dead men, I will not put it off.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Iberus responded: “I will tell you. I don’t have any family, either my own or by marriage,
  </p>
  <p>
   who will arrange my funeral when I am gone, or who will place a black ribbon around his
  </p>
  <p>
   165 Lachesis, one of the three Fates in Greek mythology, measures the thread spun on Clotho's spindle
  </p>
  <p>
   determines the thread, or length, of life.
  </p>
  <p>
   166 Nestor of Pylos was famous for having lived a long time (Horace, for example, calls him “ter aevo
  </p>
  <p>
   functus” Hor. Carm. II.9.13).
  </p>
  <p>
   416
  </p>
  <p>
   arm, or around that of a family member, in memory of me. Therefore, I have taken this
  </p>
  <p>
   responsibility upon myself, while I am still alive, that will not be done for me after I am
  </p>
  <p>
   dead. If you know where I should arrange for my tomb to be built, please advise.” Aridus
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “Perhaps in the Temple of Apollo, Minerva, or Mars?” “No,” he responded. “I will
  </p>
  <p>
   place it near the city wall, at the part where it inclines and slopes downward, the place
  </p>
  <p>
   they call the Crooked Wall.167 I believe I have found a way that no one has ever thought
  </p>
  <p>
   of for fixing my name on men’s lips in future generations, or, at least, for flitting about
  </p>
  <p>
   still living on the lips of men in a livelier fashion than Ennius. As you know, people play
  </p>
  <p>
   there with a mallet and a wooden ball, and so my rock will serve as a permanent target,
  </p>
  <p>
   a marker that every player will take aim at and where the words will forever be heard:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Let us aim our ball at Iberus’s Rock.’ It will not take much time before that place will
  </p>
  <p>
   change its name to Iberus Rock. I have a few verses here that I will arrange to have
  </p>
  <p>
   carved on it.” “By all means, read them, if you don’t mind,” said Aridus. “I confess, I
  </p>
  <p>
   have never heard a more tasteful plan for propagating one’s name.” Iberus replied: “I
  </p>
  <p>
   am unable to deny anything you ask”:
  </p>
  <p>
   Here lies Iberus, who devoted the best years of his life to military service.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he served ten whole years at court, although it made him false
  </p>
  <p>
   promises of great wealth. He barely managed to replenish his purse,
  </p>
  <p>
   which had been plundered of money, or keep hunger at bay from his
  </p>
  <p>
   parched lips. Now, where the wall descends from the sloping peak, and
  </p>
  <p>
   where people are always playing ball with wooden mallets, that dead man
  </p>
  <p>
   hopes that, if his name is placed as the target where everyone aims their
  </p>
  <p>
   balls, it will remain eternal throughout the generations.
  </p>
  <p>
   We all laughed at Iberus’s elegant and delightful talent. He then said: “That’s
  </p>
  <p>
   enough. Aridus, tomorrow I want to visit your place in the country. Prepare breakfast for
  </p>
  <p>
   167 The Crooked Wall is a reference to the Muro Torto, a steep stretch of the Aurelian Wall in Rome that
  </p>
  <p>
   begins at the Porta Pinciana and descends toward Piazzale Flaminio, cutting through the Villa Borghese.
  </p>
  <p>
   417
  </p>
  <p>
   me, or better yet, put on a sumptuous meal. Most of all, make sure you don’t offer me
  </p>
  <p>
   any insipid wine, but locate the most delightful wine available. If not, you are asking for
  </p>
  <p>
   your vines to be cut down and to pay dearly with your life.” Aridus laughed and said:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Please, this is not that story where you play the part of a braggart and ferocious
  </p>
  <p>
   soldier.”168 Entering some pharmacy, Aridus wrote this letter to a friend of his:
  </p>
  <p>
   Tomorrow, Iberus will dine with me as my guest in the country. He is hale
  </p>
  <p>
   and hearty and loves good wine. If I am not able to offer it to him, after he
  </p>
  <p>
   has stuffed himself full he will bring down many crimes of Laverna and
  </p>
  <p>
   countless troubles on my head. Because, if you do not send me a
  </p>
  <p>
   quadrantal of wine with which I once fended off a fever and a pestilential
  </p>
  <p>
   thirst, the insane anger of this Iberus will snap the grapevines on my
  </p>
  <p>
   country estate into pieces and break my head open with a stick.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Aridus had finished reading the letter, we all thanked him, took our leave,
  </p>
  <p>
   and made our way with Gallonius straight to his dynast’s villa. Gallonius was
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately admitted in to see him. After a short while, he emerged despondent. I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked him why he was so sad. He did not respond but, with his eyes raised skyward, he
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “I have wasted five years in the service of that evil man! Gods, let me never be in
  </p>
  <p>
   need of his aid.” I asked him again what had happened. He began: “After I went inside, I
  </p>
  <p>
   found him taking a stroll by himself. He stopped when he saw me and waited to hear
  </p>
  <p>
   what I wanted from him. I told him how Lyco had deceived me and I beseeched him to
  </p>
  <p>
   write a letter recommending me to the praetor. He cut me off and, barking with laughter
  </p>
  <p>
   and furrowing his brow, said: “Are you out of your mind to ask this of me? Don’t you
  </p>
  <p>
   know that I am scrupulous in these matters? The praetor will either declare you to be in
  </p>
  <p>
   the right, or he won’t. If you are in the right, you don’t need my recommendation
  </p>
  <p>
   because you will be able to obtain what is rightfully yours from that impartial officer of
  </p>
  <p>
   168 Reference to the braggart soldier in Plaut. Mil.
  </p>
  <p>
   418
  </p>
  <p>
   the court. If you are in the wrong, do you think it would be proper for me to do violence
  </p>
  <p>
   to the law and subvert a judge’s scrupulousness with my recommendation?’ Unable to
  </p>
  <p>
   contain my anger I said: ‘When exactly did this sense of obligation take hold of you?
  </p>
  <p>
   You were not this scrupulous when you vouched (in a manner that could not have been
  </p>
  <p>
   more enthusiastic, mind you) for that immoral and impious Toxillus.’ He responded
  </p>
  <p>
   angrily: ‘Get a load of the arrogance and impudence of this man! I must have hired a
  </p>
  <p>
   lord and master instead of a taster! I vouched for Toxillus because I wanted to. And now
  </p>
  <p>
   I don’t want to. What is this? Did you hear me? Or aren’t you even listening?’ When I
  </p>
  <p>
   heard these words, I figured that I shouldn’t wait around for him to fetch a stick and
  </p>
  <p>
   crush me with blows.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “What? Is this what has made you sad?” I responded. “Are you so in need of
  </p>
  <p>
   friends that nobody but your dynast can come to your aid?” “Nothing can be bought
  </p>
  <p>
   more cheaply around here than men who are willing to be in your debt. All of the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynasts are inclined toward this practice to the point of fawning. But this goes very
  </p>
  <p>
   much against my case. The praetor will think that, because my ship has broken apart,
  </p>
  <p>
   so to speak, vis-à-vis my dynast, I have gotten my hands on some stranger or other’s
  </p>
  <p>
   letter of recommendation. For this reason (and with this level of suspicion) not only will
  </p>
  <p>
   the praetor not guide the outcome of my wish toward a safe harbor, as it were, but he
  </p>
  <p>
   will even allow it to be tossed about and destroyed in a sudden storm.” Then I said:

   “What can you do? You must bear the affronts of these first citizens in silence, and you
  </p>
  <p>
   must soothe your pain with the gifts he lavishes on you daily.” “You must be joking!”
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius said: “May god punish me if, in these five years that I’ve been gnawing at my
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast’s daily rations, I have become even one gold coin richer from his gifts. But if you
  </p>
  <p>
   419
  </p>
  <p>
   had heard him when he first contracted my services, you would have immediately sworn
  </p>
  <p>
   that all of his wealth and riches would be mine, just as much as his—such were the
  </p>
  <p>
   promises that he held out in abundance. I especially remember that he promised me
  </p>
  <p>
   this: ‘Gallonius, just find some way that my favor or help can benefit you and, in that
  </p>
  <p>
   way, you will be compelled to recognize my favor and devotion toward you.’ You now
  </p>
  <p>
   see, however, what those promises have amounted to.” Seized by a poetic frenzy, I
  </p>
  <p>
   broke out into spontaneous song:
  </p>
  <p>
   Why are you beating your master with an angry tongue-lashing because
  </p>
  <p>
   he neglected to give you the support he promised? It is not right to resent
  </p>
  <p>
   an individual for ridiculing you in this way, when so many things are
  </p>
  <p>
   deceitful and fool you with their tricks. Your farm has a bad year; the sky,
  </p>
  <p>
   so frequently serene, has tricked you; and your master has destroyed your
  </p>
  <p>
   safe haven and your trust. You fool—either be harsh enough to include all
  </p>
  <p>
   of these things in your hatred, or if you don’t wish to, why are you refusing
  </p>
  <p>
   to pardon only him?
  </p>
  <p>
   “But enough of this,” Gallonius said. “I don’t want anyone’s unkindness to detract
  </p>
  <p>
   from my cheerfulness or my attention to dinner. Let’s go shopping. I want to receive you
  </p>
  <p>
   this evening in a more sumptuous and splendid manner than before, so you will
  </p>
  <p>
   understand that nobody’s affront can shake my mood.” We made our way to the
  </p>
  <p>
   marketplace, we bought lamb fries,169 chickens, different kinds of fish, and many other
  </p>
  <p>
   delicacies, and we went back to the house, dined, and went to bed right after dinner.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the anger that had arisen from his master’s ungrateful spirit prevented
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius from sleeping, and it continually elicited from him these utterances: “How
  </p>
  <p>
   unfair so many things that happen to servants are! There is nothing worse than a man
  </p>
  <p>
   who is both rich and unjust. There is nothing more expensive than an ungrateful man.
  </p>
  <p>
   169 A culinary term for lamb testicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   420
  </p>
  <p>
   There is nothing more destructive to a nation than a ruler who is generous toward bad
  </p>
  <p>
   men and stingy toward good ones. Honor falls to ruin in those communities where it
  </p>
  <p>
   perishes if you treat people properly. If people don’t trust those who hold such rewards
  </p>
  <p>
   in their hands, wicked men will always reap the benefits of honor. He who serves an
  </p>
  <p>
   ungrateful man is fishing in the air and hunting boar with a net in the middle of the
  </p>
  <p>
   ocean. A rich man who has exceedingly kind words toward the poor is like a clear sky in
  </p>
  <p>
   winter and a cloud in summer: neither is to be trusted because it can change suddenly.
  </p>
  <p>
   A man cannot stay good in a place where people are spiteful and envious of good men.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nothing is more impossible to understand than the minds of powerful men, because
  </p>
  <p>
   they highly resent things that you would not imagine. They interpret as anger what you
  </p>
  <p>
   believe is calmness and interpret as malevolence what you see as love.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Paulus Aemilius, desiring sleep more than debate, said: “What’s with you and
  </p>
  <p>
   your wise sayings? Either be quiet or go to sleep. It is pointless to complain when you
  </p>
  <p>
   are talking to a brick wall. When you go up against somebody more powerful than
  </p>
  <p>
   yourself, it will always be an unfair fight. Any wrongdoing a master commits must be
  </p>
  <p>
   thought of as right. If you turn your back on a rich man, you risk stirring up a hornet’s
  </p>
  <p>
   nest. It is foolish for you to be angry with someone who is more powerful than you. It is
  </p>
  <p>
   not appropriate for someone, who is dependent on others, to be arrogant.” “On the
  </p>
  <p>
   contrary,” responded Gallonius. “If you have done him a service you must not back
  </p>
  <p>
   down. It is wretched to realize that the services you have provided are not appreciated
  </p>
  <p>
   by the other person. He who accepts favors, but does not return them, is immoral. He is
  </p>
  <p>
   treacherous who is rich in talk, poor in action, and negligent with promises. It is better to
  </p>
  <p>
   desert a malefactor than to dismiss a benefactor.” “Criticizing what an ingrate gives you
  </p>
  <p>
   421
  </p>
  <p>
   does not change him,” offered Aemilius, “it just makes him worse; it does not placate
  </p>
  <p>
   him, it aggravates him; it doesn’t calm him, it exasperates him. Put your mind at ease, if
  </p>
  <p>
   you are wise. A calm mind can never be brought low from its proper state. It is the
  </p>
  <p>
   height of virtue to bear misfortune bravely, when necessary. Virtue is the highest prize.
  </p>
  <p>
   Virtue surpasses everything. Virtue contains all that is good within itself. All good things
  </p>
  <p>
   belong to the man who possesses virtue.” Gallonius replied: “We have already done
  </p>
  <p>
   enough philosophizing. I will do what I can, since I cannot have what I want. Am I
  </p>
  <p>
   opposing the gods? Am I as insane as the Titans? Standing up to more powerful people
  </p>
  <p>
   means doing battle with the gods like the giants did.170 But before sleep creeps up on
  </p>
  <p>
   us, let me tell you about another thing this man did, which, in my opinion, highlights the
  </p>
  <p>
   vices of pride, cruelty, and greed.” “As long as you keep it short,” said Aemilius. “You
  </p>
  <p>
   are aware of what time it is.” “You won’t be sorry,” said Gallonius. “My story will be
  </p>
  <p>
   shorter than a dwarf.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Among the members of my dynast’s household there is a certain Nicius Rufus171
  </p>
  <p>
   who was born to a reputable social rank and was devoted to the study of letters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreover, he was so well equipped with the benefits of Fortune that he didn’t need
  </p>
  <p>
   anything from anyone. Fifteen years ago, he was enticed by my dynast into his
  </p>
  <p>
   household, with large promises, to serve as his secretary of the records. My dynast had
  </p>
  <p>
   started feeling ashamed that everything about himself was more brutish than human,
  </p>
  <p>
   and therefore he wished to distance himself as much as possible, through the services
  </p>
  <p>
   170 This is a reference to the Gigantomachia when the race of giants (gigantes) fought against the gods of
  </p>
  <p>
   Olympus.
  </p>
  <p>
   171 This is a reference to the author himself (rufus means “red,” i.e., Rossi) and is a fictionalized account
  </p>
  <p>
   of his time in the service of Cardinal Peretti-Montalto from 1610 to 1623. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. V n. 14.
  </p>
  <p>
   422
  </p>
  <p>
   of a scholar like Rufus, from the company of beasts. Since Rufus didn’t fit in at all with
  </p>
  <p>
   the dynast’s princely surroundings, he didn’t want to stay with the dynast under the
  </p>
  <p>
   same roof. Instead, he rented another house which was attached to the back of the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast’s villa. Rufus had a hole cut through the wall, with the full knowledge of the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast, to create a passage to his house through the dynast’s kitchen. Since the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast’s house (which was as big as a city) extended a long way inside and was
  </p>
  <p>
   hemmed in on all sides by countless private dwellings, it was hard to reach the front
  </p>
  <p>
   door of Rufus’s house without going the long way around. This was a great
  </p>
  <p>
   inconvenience for Rufus, especially in the winter when he spent many hours, almost
  </p>
  <p>
   every night, at his master’s house. But within a few months after the dynast had broken
  </p>
  <p>
   through the wall, the cook stole some worn-out and torn little blankets that were among
  </p>
  <p>
   that barbaric dynast’s household furnishings. When this theft came to light, the dynast
  </p>
  <p>
   reckoned that the thief had entered via that passageway and, moved by anger, he
  </p>
  <p>
   ordered the hole in the wall to be closed up immediately. So that honorable man Rufus
  </p>
  <p>
   (who, mind you, had been in the dynast’s household since he was a bright young boy)
  </p>
  <p>
   was forced, after fifteen whole years, to make his way, every single day, to the dynast’s
  </p>
  <p>
   house—outside, in the dead of night, and sometimes in freezing weather and giant
  </p>
  <p>
   rainstorms—via a long, circuitous route. Under no circumstances would Rufus have
  </p>
  <p>
   ever tolerated such indignity and disregard toward himself, had he not feared gaining
  </p>
  <p>
   the reputation as an unreliable person in a city that is so prone to slander. But I think we
  </p>
  <p>
   should go to sleep.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Book Six
  </p>
  <p>
   Since it was almost time to depart, we got up at daybreak and began preparing
  </p>
  <p>
   for our journey. We bought clothes made of linen and wool. In addition to these clothes
  </p>
  <p>
   423
  </p>
  <p>
   we also packed the finest wines, bread, ham, bacon, sow’s udder, sausages, and other
  </p>
  <p>
   foods of this sort, so we wouldn’t have to drink the same wine as the oarsmen or always
  </p>
  <p>
   have to eat ship’s biscuit. Our purse was left almost emptied of money, something that
  </p>
  <p>
   was a necessity for embarking on a voyage. So, in addition to everything else, we had
  </p>
  <p>
   to turn our attention to replenishing it. For this reason we decided to sell our emeralds,
  </p>
  <p>
   topaz, diamonds, pearls, and other gemstones of that sort, which we had brought with
  </p>
  <p>
   us from Rome. When Gallonius saw our jewels he said: “I will assume responsibility for
  </p>
  <p>
   making sure you get as much as much as possible for them. Extravagance and greed
  </p>
  <p>
   have made the value of gemstones (which is perhaps stagnant in Rome because of
  </p>
  <p>
   their sheer number) skyrocket here. As a matter of fact, this entire island, while it is rich
  </p>
  <p>
   in wine, olive oil, wheat, gold, and silver, is almost devoid and empty of these luxuries,
  </p>
  <p>
   and merchants rarely travel here with these sorts of goods. But we need a broker who
  </p>
  <p>
   can find you a buyer. I will assign to you the same middleman whom everyone uses for
  </p>
  <p>
   these kinds of transactions. We need to hurry so we can catch him at home.”
  </p>
  <p>
   We listened to Gallonius and got a move on. A servant of the scholar Aridus met
  </p>
  <p>
   us as we were rushing along and said: “Greetings, Gallonius! Where are you going?
  </p>
  <p>
   And why are you in such an all-fired hurry?” Gallonius replied: “I am going to your
  </p>
  <p>
   neighbor Zancha’s house (that was the name of the broker). I was handed some
  </p>
  <p>
   business just now that requires me to meet with him.” The servant said: “He isn’t home,
  </p>
  <p>
   so I’d hate for you to waste a trip. But if you really want a meeting with him, what would
  </p>
  <p>
   be in it for me if I showed you where you could find him, with little effort and without
  </p>
  <p>
   going out of your way?” “Tell us where he is,” replied Gallonius. “We are very busy, so
  </p>
  <p>
   please don’t cause us any delay.” “I recently left him at Natalicius the goldsmith’s
  </p>
  <p>
   424
  </p>
  <p>
   workshop at the Middle Janus. But you would do well to walk slowly and not hurt
  </p>
  <p>
   yourselves on his account. I heard him say he was going to be there for many hours,
  </p>
  <p>
   and that he was going to be helping out Pamphilus who has gotten married.” “What is
  </p>
  <p>
   that you say?” said Gallonius. “Pamphilus is married?” “Certainly,” he replied. “And
  </p>
  <p>
   what’s even more surprising, he married a carpenter’s daughter. But you will learn the
  </p>
  <p>
   whole story from him, since he talks about it openly with everyone.” “I thank you very
  </p>
  <p>
   much,” said Gallonius. “But where are you heading with those papers you are carrying?”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I am bringing them to Dynast Thersippus,172 whom my master has invited to his villa at
  </p>
  <p>
   his country estate, which is called Cinnus. You may read them if you like. They are filled
  </p>
  <p>
   with verses and they don’t contain anything private.” “I would love to,” replied Gallonius,
  </p>
  <p>
   and he handed me the papers he had received from the servant. While I read the
  </p>
  <p>
   verses over carefully, Aemilius was writing them down in the notebook he had at the
  </p>
  <p>
   ready:
  </p>
  <p>
   Thersippus, capable both in your studies and your talents, add power to
  </p>
  <p>
   your unceasing wisdom and look after yourself by hurrying quickly to that
  </p>
  <p>
   place where Cinnus lies wet with loud, flowing waters. Why should we
  </p>
  <p>
   refrain from freeing our mind from worry? Just as birds are eager to play in
  </p>
  <p>
   the treetops of the forest after they have finished laboring, the mind, after
  </p>
  <p>
   being constrained for a long period, also loves flying about not entwined in
  </p>
  <p>
   the arduous restraints of work. My tall house in the country is not built out
  </p>
  <p>
   of stone, nor the walls out of gold, but it is solid, small, and manageable
  </p>
  <p>
   where goodness flourishes even more. Virtue has made you courteous, so
  </p>
  <p>
   you are able to patiently bear the luxuries of the powerful and suffer the
  </p>
  <p>
   contemptible poverty of the destitute.
  </p>
  <p>
   172 Scipione Cobelluzzi (1564-1626), Cardinal of Santa Susanna, was an Italian cardinal, librarian, and
  </p>
  <p>
   archivist. As well as serving as the archivist for the Vatican Secret Archives, he was the parish priest of
  </p>
  <p>
   Church of Saint Susanna at the Baths of Diocletian from 1616 until his death in 1626. Rossi devotes a
  </p>
  <p>
   portrait to Cobelluzzi in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   425
  </p>
  <p>
   After I had read the verses a couple of times, I handed them back to the servant who
  </p>
  <p>
   had showed them to us. He bade us farewell and set off on the journey he had begun.
  </p>
  <p>
   On his advice, we slowly and gradually began making our way toward Janus Gate.
  </p>
  <p>
   As we were walking, I eagerly asked Gallonius what kind of person Thersippus
  </p>
  <p>
   was, whether he was a literary man who corresponded with learned men, or whether he
  </p>
  <p>
   was a lover of the countryside who sought the delights of his country estate. “By all
  </p>
  <p>
   means,” said Gallonius, “he is quite a wise man in his own estimation; but in others’
  </p>
  <p>
   judgment, he is not an idiot. He excels in intelligence, in his knowledge of antiquity, and
  </p>
  <p>
   in his expertise in civil law. However, his estimation of his skills is much greater than the
  </p>
  <p>
   level of skill he actually possesses. With his face and his expression, and by admiring
  </p>
  <p>
   and scoffing, he tries to persuade the goddess of eloquence to cling to his lips and
  </p>
  <p>
   jurisprudence to reign in his mind as if in a citadel. Nevertheless, he behaves in a
  </p>
  <p>
   friendly and kind way toward those learned in the law, who seek him out on account of
  </p>
  <p>
   his position. But his goodwill toward them is contained exclusively in words, which he
  </p>
  <p>
   rarely, if ever, transforms into action. You can hardly find even a couple of people who
  </p>
  <p>
   have achieved riches or public offices because of his influence. But look, here he is. He
  </p>
  <p>
   is the one you see being carried inside that sedan chair.” It was the height of summer,
  </p>
  <p>
   the temperatures were extreme, and, in spite of this, Thersippus was being carried
  </p>
  <p>
   around enclosed on all sides, such that there was nobody more fortified or protected
  </p>
  <p>
   against the elements, even the gentle assault of a breeze.173 The two little windows on
  </p>
  <p>
   173 Rossi mentions this character, in a 1638 letter he wrote in defense of his satire, as an example of
  </p>
  <p>
   something that he was being accused of criticizing but that, in fact, was perfectly normal (though it was
  </p>
  <p>
   not, of course): “quisnam unquam notandum eum esse infamia existimavit, qui caloribus summis, vitandi
  </p>
  <p>
   frigoris causa, gestatoria sella inclusum se per Urbem deferri jussisset?” (“Who would ever think that
  </p>
  <p>
   someone should be given a bad name for insisting on being carried about the city enclosed in a sedan
  </p>
  <p>
   chair in order to avoid the cold at the height of summer?” Ep. ad div. 1.VI.V).
  </p>
  <p>
   426
  </p>
  <p>
   either side of the carriage, as well as the one at the front, were covered in glass and
  </p>
  <p>
   were opened for the sole purpose of letting in light. He had covered his head with many
  </p>
  <p>
   scarves and had carefully wrapped his body in a cloak. We wondered at the man’s
  </p>
  <p>
   studied determination in warding off the cold.
  </p>
  <p>
   After passing through Middle Janus, we arrived in the place where we were told
  </p>
  <p>
   the broker would be, and we found him sitting between two men who were laughing
  </p>
  <p>
   uncontrollably. Gallonius got there first and greeted him. He showed the broker the
  </p>
  <p>
   gemstones and asked him to find a buyer for them. The broker picked them up,
  </p>
  <p>
   examined them, praised them, and said: “I have never seen anyone arrive at a more
  </p>
  <p>
   opportune time. Today I have to fit out a woman’s toilet for Pamphilus to send to the
  </p>
  <p>
   bride he married.” Gallonius replied: “I heard about that and was amazed that such a
  </p>
  <p>
   rich and noble young man had stooped to such humbleness as to be willing to marry a
  </p>
  <p>
   carpenter’s daughter. Does he have such a shortage of marriage prospects?” “Yes, that
  </p>
  <p>
   is correct,” said Zancha. “It could not have turned out any other way. He was compelled
  </p>
  <p>
   by force.” Gallonius asked: “What force compels you to have what you don’t want?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Zancha replied: “The story is absurd, and I had just begun telling it to these men.” “Start
  </p>
  <p>
   from the beginning, if you don’t mind,” said Gallonius. “I am dying to hear it.” “Then
  </p>
  <p>
   listen up,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   A young man suddenly burst in, cutting Zancha off as he was attempting to
  </p>
  <p>
   speak, and came at Natalicius with these words: “Please, what kind of a woman did you
  </p>
  <p>
   give me to marry? There is no woman more shameful and depraved than she. I just
  </p>
  <p>
   caught her kissing some young man! If I ever see anything like that again, I’ll divorce
  </p>
  <p>
   her, throw her out, and send her packing back to you, her father!” Natalicius was greatly
  </p>
  <p>
   427
  </p>
  <p>
   disturbed by this and said: “Does it strike you as so surprising for a young woman to be
  </p>
  <p>
   so out of control? In fact, you would not find many young women who have not been
  </p>
  <p>
   drawn to such delights and pleasures by the heat of adolescence. These things are part
  </p>
  <p>
   and parcel of the experience of adolescence, but this heat dies down and comes to an
  </p>
  <p>
   end at the same time adolescence itself does. In the meantime, let her devote some
  </p>
  <p>
   time to youth’s flirtations. But, from what I hear, she is imitating her mother. Her mother
  </p>
  <p>
   (who is my wife) used to flirt in such a way that her advances could have been
  </p>
  <p>
   distributed among each and every man throughout the whole population. However, now
  </p>
  <p>
   that she is older, she is so removed from these trifles that there exists no more virtuous
  </p>
  <p>
   or better lady of the house.” The young man, not at all placated by this response,
  </p>
  <p>
   muttered something under his breath and left. As he was leaving, Zancha began to
  </p>
  <p>
   speak.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In this city, next to the forum of Apollo, lives a certain carpenter named
  </p>
  <p>
   Baldoccius, who, in his piety and simplicity, undoubtedly subscribes to those old
  </p>
  <p>
   traditions of ancient men rather than to the customs that are currently in vogue. And
  </p>
  <p>
   there is no fault to be found or uncovered in him, other than a fondness for wine. It has
  </p>
  <p>
   such a hold on him that not an hour of the day goes by when, as he himself says, he is
  </p>
  <p>
   not pouring at least half a liter of wine into his belly. For the rest, there is nothing
  </p>
  <p>
   insincere or fake about him. On the contrary, everything is exposed and out in the open,
  </p>
  <p>
   which is why he is considered an easy target for wrongdoing. Indeed, he is prone to
  </p>
  <p>
   entrusting his counsel to everyone, keeping his word, returning a deposit without
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses, and he is often deceived and cheated by con men. This man took as his wife
  </p>
  <p>
   Antina, a woman from his hometown, who is attached to him by a similarity of character
  </p>
  <p>
   428
  </p>
  <p>
   as much as by their association in life. She was no sharper than her husband and no
  </p>
  <p>
   more skilled in looking out for herself. She hired out her services for reconciling kinfolk,
  </p>
  <p>
   evaluating women’s ornaments, and adorning and accompanying new brides. As a
  </p>
  <p>
   result, she happened to always be away from the house.
  </p>
  <p>
   “She gave birth to a daughter by Baldoccius, named Tensa, who was more
  </p>
  <p>
   beautiful than all of the Graces,174 but was easily on par with any con man in terms of
  </p>
  <p>
   her dishonesty and wickedness. She was unbelievably crafty, bold, daring, deceitful,
  </p>
  <p>
   and prating; she had a mouth on her, a tongue, duplicity, and wickedness. She was
  </p>
  <p>
   quick to lie, dissemble, and deny everything, and through her fast-talking she convinced
  </p>
  <p>
   people that they had not seen what they saw and had not done what they did. As I
  </p>
  <p>
   described before, within the last few months both of her parents went out (which was
  </p>
  <p>
   not a good idea) and left her, a maiden in full flower, at home alone. Her father thought
  </p>
  <p>
   that she would be safe enough from anyone who wished to prey on her body if he threw
  </p>
  <p>
   a bar, the diameter of one finger, across the entrance to their shop. But the facts
  </p>
  <p>
   themselves showed that such a great and so secure a fortress was hardly safe against
  </p>
  <p>
   the ambush of an enemy. Indeed, that most handsome Pamphilus, the young man you
  </p>
  <p>
   just met, was able to penetrate it. During the following Saturnalia,175 when Baldoccius
  </p>
  <p>
   had gone out earlier than usual to sample a friend’s wine, the enemy entered a
  </p>
  <p>
   fortification that was cleared of all defenders, and, after engaging in battle, took
  </p>
  <p>
   possession of his booty. What else is there to say? While Baldoccius spent a joyous day
  </p>
  <p>
   174 In Greek mythology the three Graces, usually considered to be the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome
  </p>
  <p>
   (and sometimes of Dionysus and Aphrodite), were Aglaea (splendor), Euphrosyne (mirth), and Thalia
  </p>
  <p>
   (good cheer).
  </p>
  <p>
   175 A festival in honor of Saturn that began on the 17th of December and lasted for several days.
  </p>
  <p>
   429
  </p>
  <p>
   drinking from broad and deep wine bowls, the lovers also satisfied themselves with
  </p>
  <p>
   pleasures to the point of intoxication. And they did not only yield to their inclinations that
  </p>
  <p>
   day but on every day after that, during the times when Baldoccius, after barricading the
  </p>
  <p>
   door, as I said, was devoting himself to Liber in some tavern or other, such that there
  </p>
  <p>
   was no more secure an approach inside that fortress than if it had been defended by a
  </p>
  <p>
   rampart.
  </p>
  <p>
   “On the first day of May, however, while the lovers were freely indulging their
  </p>
  <p>
   appetites after Baldoccius and Antina had left the house, they were very nearly caught
  </p>
  <p>
   red-handed in their shameful act. When evening was drawing near, and they had not
  </p>
  <p>
   yet satisfied their desire for sport, Tensa’s parents came home unexpectedly. Because
  </p>
  <p>
   of this a great fear took hold of the young man. The girl, not afraid of anything, said
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Don’t be scared. I will give you a ready plan for escape. I’m only sorry that we will be
  </p>
  <p>
   separated sooner than I’d like.’ Heading straight up from the ground floor, she arrived at
  </p>
  <p>
   a terrace that was connected to a bedroom on the right side, and on the left side exited
  </p>
  <p>
   to the kitchen where at that moment a large sack of wheat was being stored. She sliced
  </p>
  <p>
   the sack open with a knife, opened the large window to let the wheat pour out, and
  </p>
  <p>
   raising a shout she cried: ‘Help! Mice have been gnawing on our sack of wheat and all
  </p>
  <p>
   the grain is pouring out!’ While her parents were running over and rushing to collect, in
  </p>
  <p>
   little baskets, the wheat that was going to waste, the young man gathered his things and
  </p>
  <p>
   left. Tensa, not interested in any pleasure that was associated with danger and dread,
  </p>
  <p>
   began thinking to herself how she could engage in pleasure that was pure and
  </p>
  <p>
   untarnished by fear.
  </p>
  <p>
   430
  </p>
  <p>
   “Tensa reached into her bag of tricks and began planning a ruse that would leave
  </p>
  <p>
   her parents’ naiveté at a disadvantage. She was clever at devising and contriving, so
  </p>
  <p>
   when her parents returned home at dusk—after Pamphilus had visited her and she had
  </p>
  <p>
   satisfactorily fulfilled her desires—Tensa appeared before them dejected and run down.
  </p>
  <p>
   When they asked her what was wrong, she did not dare speak and, instead of words,
  </p>
  <p>
   she poured forth a large quantity of tears. When she finally felt compelled to speak, she
  </p>
  <p>
   told them that there were certain ghosts who frequented the homes of virgins, in human
  </p>
  <p>
   form and shape, and fell hopelessly in love with them. She told her parents that she had
  </p>
  <p>
   seen one of these ghosts, and that he was so beautiful and so lovely that no being
  </p>
  <p>
   could possibly surpass him. To which her mother replied: ‘What is this I hear? Watch
  </p>
  <p>
   out that you have not let fear convince your eyes of this.’ Tensa replied: ‘You are wrong,
  </p>
  <p>
   mother. I have never felt such joy as when I laid eyes on him.’ Antina said: ‘Cheer up
  </p>
  <p>
   and cast off this grief that is tormenting you. I hope you never see that ghost again.’ ‘Ah,
  </p>
  <p>
   but you don’t understand, mother, how firmly he sticks in my mind.’ When she had
  </p>
  <p>
   finished speaking, she focused on getting food and rest, which was something she was
  </p>
  <p>
   very much in need of. The next day, Pamphilus returned as a strange spirit, the sort that
  </p>
  <p>
   people call “incubi.”176 In order to win over the woman’s parents, he left behind a pair of
  </p>
  <p>
   earrings and a necklace for Tensa that were freshly made, which she showed to her
  </p>
  <p>
   parents with a happy heart. They picked the items up, examined them, praised them,
  </p>
  <p>
   and admired them as if they had come from the workshop of Vulcan himself. Even
  </p>
  <p>
   though they hadn’t seen him yet, they already felt compelled to like such a
  </p>
  <p>
   176 Incubus: from the verb incubo (“to lie upon”) denotes both the sender of the dream and the dream
  </p>
  <p>
   itself. As the sender of a dream, the incubus is a demon in male form. Christian authors often stressed
  </p>
  <p>
   the incubi’s desire for intercourse with women (Aug. Civ. 15.23.108).
  </p>
  <p>
   431
  </p>
  <p>
   discriminating and generous ghost. By continuing to give these gifts, Pamphilus
  </p>
  <p>
   succeeded in making himself dearer than anything to Tensa’s parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Antina, as women do, burned with an unbelievable desire to see the ghost, but
  </p>
  <p>
   she was also terrified. Because Pamphilus had brought so many gifts, however, and
  </p>
  <p>
   because of her daughter’s persuasive words when describing his form and beauty, she
  </p>
  <p>
   decided to get a look at him with her own eyes. Pamphilus, as you saw for yourself, is
  </p>
  <p>
   nineteen years old, has wavy hair, dark eyes, fair cheeks that were slightly blushing,
  </p>
  <p>
   and no trace of a beard. Moreover, he always looked refined with regards to the way he
  </p>
  <p>
   dressed and adorned himself, just as his riches (which were fairly ample) would allow.
  </p>
  <p>
   For this reason, as soon as Antina caught sight of him she exclaimed: ‘Gosh, how
  </p>
  <p>
   elegant he is! Who says that ghosts are monstrous? By god, if all of them had a face
  </p>
  <p>
   like his, I wouldn’t mind if all the ghosts that ever existed moved into my house. That
  </p>
  <p>
   way, I wouldn’t have to always look at Baldoccius’s ghastly mug.’
  </p>
  <p>
   “But Baldoccius had already told the neighbors the whole story about the ghost’s
  </p>
  <p>
   love and gifts, and his stupidity provided them glorious entertainment and fodder for
  </p>
  <p>
   gossip. When asked whether the spirit had horns, he replied: ‘Damnit, why does it cross
  </p>
  <p>
   your mind to think such a thing about this ghost? I cannot easily say I have ever seen a
  </p>
  <p>
   more beautiful creature.’ ‘That’s absurd,’ responded another. ‘If he does not have horns,
  </p>
  <p>
   it is surely because he has given them to you.’177 Baldoccius replied: ‘May the great
  </p>
  <p>
   Jupiter damn you for thinking that ghosts made of air and wind have sexual relations
  </p>
  <p>
   like humans do.’ The other man replied: ‘What if this virile wind has inflated your
  </p>
  <p>
   177 The play on words here involves the Latin word for horns (cornua) and the expression “giving horns” to
  </p>
  <p>
   someone (i.e., making someone a cuckold).
  </p>
  <p>
   432
  </p>
  <p>
   daughter’s womb? What would you say to that?’ Other neighbors, pitying Baldoccius’s
  </p>
  <p>
   stupidity, advised him, on account of their friendship and affinity, to avoid a great
  </p>
  <p>
   scandal and to drive that trickster as far as possible out of his house with a stick. He
  </p>
  <p>
   responded that it was jealousy making them say these things, and that it was entirely
  </p>
  <p>
   his own business if there was one ghost living in his house or a thousand of them. One
  </p>
  <p>
   of the neighbors said: ‘Are you really inviting this level of damage to your reputation for
  </p>
  <p>
   such meager financial gain? Watch out that this evil ghost doesn’t hurt your daughter
  </p>
  <p>
   when it comes time to give her away in marriage. Don’t you know how valuable a girl’s
  </p>
  <p>
   reputation is when brokering a good match?’ To which Baldoccius replied: ‘Be quiet, you
  </p>
  <p>
   idiot. Don’t you see how people are nowadays?’
  </p>
  <p>
   In this place a girl can get married with this type of reputation. So long as
  </p>
  <p>
   she has a dowry, no one can find fault with her.178
  </p>
  <p>
   “What more can I say? Baldoccius was sooner persuaded that there were flying
  </p>
  <p>
   donkeys than that ghosts, consisting of air and wind, would bring any shame upon
  </p>
  <p>
   himself and his daughter. But events thwarted his beliefs because that very air, forged
  </p>
  <p>
   into thick and fleshy humors, caused Tensa’s belly to swell beyond measure. At first
  </p>
  <p>
   Tensa convinced her parents that she was suffering from a skin condition, namely fluid
  </p>
  <p>
   in her tissues, not from an illness of her insides. Later, when her due date was
  </p>
  <p>
   approaching, she confided in her mother the true cause of her sickness, but she did not
  </p>
  <p>
   blame it on her ghost companion, or any other man, but on a certain dream she had.
  </p>
  <p>
   She reported dreaming, seven months ago, that she had sex with a certain young man,
  </p>
  <p>
   and that from that day on her belly started swelling and, little by little, it grew to its
  </p>
  <p>
   178 English translation from Plautus and de Melo (2011-13).
  </p>
  <p>
   433
  </p>
  <p>
   current size. Antina, although she was stupid (and a mother), did not immediately
  </p>
  <p>
   believe this story, but whenever she encountered a doctor or a friend she would
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately ask whether her daughter could have become pregnant without having
  </p>
  <p>
   sexual intercourse. Different people gave her different answers. There was someone
  </p>
  <p>
   who asked whether what the daughter experienced while awake should be attributed to
  </p>
  <p>
   a dream. To which Antina responded: ‘Don’t think such a thing about my daughter. She
  </p>
  <p>
   is even more pure and inviolable than any dove.’ ‘As if doves don’t have offspring!’ the
  </p>
  <p>
   man replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   “To make a long story short, Antina remained in a state of suspense and
  </p>
  <p>
   uncertainty, until she finally saw that cock entering her dove. When she was keeping
  </p>
  <p>
   watch through a crack in the door to see what was happening inside, she saw what she
  </p>
  <p>
   (had she not been so foolish) should have already comprehended, and she finally
  </p>
  <p>
   noticed what sort of Underworld that Erinys179 sprang from. Mad with grief, she began to
  </p>
  <p>
   shout; to appeal to the goodwill of her fellow citizens; and to tell them she had caught
  </p>
  <p>
   the filthy trickster, that blight upon her family and corruptor of their daughter. At this
  </p>
  <p>
   point all of the neighbors ran to help her, and they scolded the young man for
  </p>
  <p>
   shamelessly tricking honest people and for violating a tender maiden. They also
  </p>
  <p>
   threatened that they would carry him off to jail, or before a judge, who, by, imposing a
  </p>
  <p>
   punishment, would wash that indelible mark of shame off of those most upstanding
  </p>
  <p>
   people. You can understand how that young man’s mind was tossed this way and that
  </p>
  <p>
   for a few moments. But his love for Tensa and their relationship moved Pamphilus more
  </p>
  <p>
   than the threats of those men did; and separation, discord, and destruction were
  </p>
  <p>
   179 In Greek mythology the Erinyes, also known as the Furies, were the deities of vengeance.
  </p>
  <p>
   434
  </p>
  <p>
   imminent unless he paid attention to this love. For this reason the young man, who was
  </p>
  <p>
   rich and held the highest rank among his own people, was deeply moved and deigned
  </p>
  <p>
   to request this carpenter’s daughter’s hand in marriage. Baldoccius immediately
  </p>
  <p>
   promised Tensa to him. But it seems the day has arrived that the young man is
  </p>
  <p>
   regretting this marriage.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius replied: “But it will not be difficult for him to abandon this marriage
  </p>
  <p>
   whenever he wants to, and to join with another woman who is more suitable for him in
  </p>
  <p>
   terms of social rank, wealth, and reputation.” Wondering at this I said: “I had heard that
  </p>
  <p>
   marriages in Eudemia were everlasting and put asunder only by death. By what avenue
  </p>
  <p>
   will he pursue this unholy action?” “By the avenue that lies open and is already well
  </p>
  <p>
   trodden by the footsteps of many. The same one that Antiphila recently embarked on if
  </p>
  <p>
   she can clearly prove, with witnesses, that her marriage was joined not solemnly and
  </p>
  <p>
   legally but by force and fear. After all, a judge restores possession of that from which
  </p>
  <p>
   one has been forcibly driven.” “What is this I hear?” said Natalitius, “Antiphila is a
  </p>
  <p>
   divorcee with her husband still alive? That same Antiphila who married Demophon the
  </p>
  <p>
   spice merchant?” “The very one,” said Gallonius. As a matter of fact, since she was
  </p>
  <p>
   beaten by her husband after being caught (not infrequently) in the act of adultery, she
  </p>
  <p>
   fabricated a story—four years after her husband had taken her hand—that her marriage
  </p>
  <p>
   had been coerced by fear; and she therefore saw to it that it was dissolved and put
  </p>
  <p>
   asunder. This was immediately executed by the work of some scribe, the recklessness
  </p>
  <p>
   of which profession in perpetrating these and other abominable activities greatly
  </p>
  <p>
   benefits the most immoral men.” Tensa’s expert tricks and her plans, so cleverly
  </p>
  <p>
   devised in her heart to deceive, moved us with such delight that I exclaimed: “Zancha,
  </p>
  <p>
   435
  </p>
  <p>
   your amusing and enjoyable story is worth more than the gemstones that you are
  </p>
  <p>
   tasked to sell for us.” Zancha replied: “If that is how it seems to you, hand over the
  </p>
  <p>
   gemstones. What is more, you can declare them to be of diminished value. But I believe
  </p>
  <p>
   you are making fun of me, and I don’t think you have come here to buy witty sayings at
  </p>
  <p>
   such a great price. So follow me.” He grabbed our hands, led us into the forum, and
  </p>
  <p>
   ordered the banker to count out three large silver talents for us. We headed home
  </p>
  <p>
   happy because our merchandise had brought such a successful return and we were
  </p>
  <p>
   flush with cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   On our way back home, we happened upon a crowd of people. Dynast Orius,
  </p>
  <p>
   who was also the priest of Ceres,180 was on his way to perform religious rites to the
  </p>
  <p>
   goddess at her temple in a solemn ritual. His entire household was walking ahead of
  </p>
  <p>
   him, and among them many other distinguished men were following him out of respect.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next came his attendants, one of whom was carrying a ewer, another a bowl, and
  </p>
  <p>
   another a box filled with frankincense. Flamen Orius was following them dressed in a
  </p>
  <p>
   woolen cloak, and wherever he went noblemen and common people made way for him,
  </p>
  <p>
   doffed their hats, and knelt before him. Among those making way for him, we
  </p>
  <p>
   recognized some who had won great praise for their talents in that gathering of scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   we had attended three days before. Flamen Orius, however, standing erect and tall, did
  </p>
  <p>
   not give his attention to any one person but looked down his nose at everyone equally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the commoners, who had rushed to see Flamen Orius, there was one man
  </p>
  <p>
   dressed in a leather tunic with a belt around his waist from which many tools were
  </p>
  <p>
   hanging such as a hammer, pincers, a hoof knife, and a sack full of nails. Flamen Orius
  </p>
  <p>
   180 The ancient goddess of grain.
  </p>
  <p>
   436
  </p>
  <p>
   called this man over to him, dressed as he was, invited the man to walk alongside him,
  </p>
  <p>
   and asked him how he was doing, whether he was in good health, whether the pain had
  </p>
  <p>
   diminished on his horse’s hooves, which he had brought to him to be treated, and
  </p>
  <p>
   whether there was any hope that his horse would recover.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greatly astonished at this, I said: “Gallonius, why did this great man, who holds
  </p>
  <p>
   such an important priesthood, show disregard and scorn to many honorable men (at the
  </p>
  <p>
   very moment that he, adorned with pontifical emblems, was about to devote himself to
  </p>
  <p>
   the most solemn matter of all) and instead choose this raggedy man to walk in the
  </p>
  <p>
   procession with and strike up a conversation? What two people are more different than
  </p>
  <p>
   a pontiff and a blacksmith? What things are more contrary and different than a pontifical
  </p>
  <p>
   cloak and the tools of a farrier? I honestly don’t see how it’s possible to be amazed
  </p>
  <p>
   enough at the flamen’s reasoning.” “It is foolish and stupid, by god,” said Gallonius. “But
  </p>
  <p>
   what can you do? As you can guess from how he is dressed, this man shoes horses.
  </p>
  <p>
   People conduct their lives in Eudemia in such a way that the leading men care more
  </p>
  <p>
   about their pet horses, monkeys, or any other worthless animal than about any of the
  </p>
  <p>
   literary and honest men. If one of these honest men finds himself lying sick in bed,
  </p>
  <p>
   nobody ever comes to visit him or sends any word that his health is of any concern to
  </p>
  <p>
   him.181 But if someone’s horse has a sore hoof, there are immediate cries and
  </p>
  <p>
   complaints, people summon whoever is able to shoe the horse, they pray for its health,
  </p>
  <p>
   they visit it, and they spare no effort, expense, or labor. This is because upstanding and
  </p>
  <p>
   learned men are held in no regard and have no status, while beasts are highly
  </p>
  <p>
   181 This complaint is reminiscent of Rossi’s own complaint against his erstwhile employer Alessandro
  </p>
  <p>
   Damasceni Peretti di Montalto, which he voices in a 1637 letter to Ugo Ubaldini lamenting that, when he
  </p>
  <p>
   was once sick in bed, Peretti never once asked after him (Ep. ad div. 2.II.V).
  </p>
  <p>
   437
  </p>
  <p>
   cherished. I can add to this that all of the positions in this republic, which should be
  </p>
  <p>
   offered to a person on account of his hard work, are filled instead on the basis of
  </p>
  <p>
   friendship and favors. For example, if someone needs to find someone to write his
  </p>
  <p>
   letters or legal opinions, that person does not immediately go out and hire the most
  </p>
  <p>
   eloquent or learned person. No, he hires the person recommended by his friends, or
  </p>
  <p>
   who is useful or advantageous to him in some way. The result is that the letters or legal
  </p>
  <p>
   opinions of these people, which they spend no effort on, are ridiculed by those who do
  </p>
  <p>
   have skills in these areas.” Irritated, I then said: “Let’s go home and restore ourselves
  </p>
  <p>
   with breakfast. I am embarrassed to stay any longer in this city. It’s worse than the one
  </p>
  <p>
   we escaped from.” We arrived home, found our breakfast table prepared, and sat down.
  </p>
  <p>
   A little while later, a messenger arrived from the ship’s captain, who strongly urged us to
  </p>
  <p>
   get going (if we still intended to go), saying that the wind was favorable and that we
  </p>
  <p>
   were holding everyone up. Therefore, we got up from the table, took off the clothes we
  </p>
  <p>
   had gotten from Gallonius, changed into our own clothes, and hurried off with the
  </p>
  <p>
   messenger toward the port. We boarded the ship and left Gallonius behind after
  </p>
  <p>
   embracing him once and again, and after giving him a gift of a necklace and a ring set
  </p>
  <p>
   with one of our gemstones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius had barely taken his leave, when a certain painter arrived, whom they
  </p>
  <p>
   called Ballio,182 who fervently begged us to have the ship take him on board as well,
  </p>
  <p>
   along with a woman who he claimed was his wife. The captain, who knew this man and
  </p>
  <p>
   enjoyed his artistic talent, did not rebuff him, even though the ship was full, and he
  </p>
  <p>
   asked: “What’s this I hear about your wife? Isn’t this woman Nice the common whore?
  </p>
  <p>
   182 Ballio is the name of a pimp in Plaut. Pseud. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. VI n. 4.
  </p>
  <p>
   438
  </p>
  <p>
   When did she become your wife?” “I will tell you,” said Ballio. “I was having relations
  </p>
  <p>
   with this woman, along with many others. But ten days ago, when I had paid for a night
  </p>
  <p>
   with her, I don’t know which god influenced me to whisk her away from the business of
  </p>
  <p>
   prostitution and marry her. That same night, I took her back to my house, together with
  </p>
  <p>
   all her things, and, at the same time, I listed her house for rent. The next morning her
  </p>
  <p>
   lovers arrived. Callidius the grain merchant was the first to come and see that her house
  </p>
  <p>
   was vacant and for rent. He made inquiries, asking those people who had been
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses to my shackling (for, truly, a wife is nothing other than a veritable ball and
  </p>
  <p>
   chain), and he found out that I had married her. ‘My god,’ he said, ‘if that is the case, the
  </p>
  <p>
   ten pecks of wheat I gave her, so her door would be open to me for a whole year, have
  </p>
  <p>
   gone over to her husband’s granary.’ Creopolis lanius arrived next complaining that he
  </p>
  <p>
   had been tricked out of two huge racks of meat. Thermopota the innkeeper arrived
  </p>
  <p>
   grumbling that his wine, which would have been enough to last the woman a whole
  </p>
  <p>
   year, had been stolen from him through Ballio’s plan. The bankrupt Harpax rushed over
  </p>
  <p>
   and was indignant that he had been taken for fifteen minae of the money he had shaved
  </p>
  <p>
   off his creditors. Other merchants showed up too. She had given her attention to each
  </p>
  <p>
   of them (once she had accepted their goods), and each of them reproached the woman,
  </p>
  <p>
   in her absence, as a manifest thief. A few days later, they all went to court before the
  </p>
  <p>
   praetor, they attacked her in unison, and each one of them brought a suit against her.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since she could not fend off so many men, and didn’t think she should have to worry
  </p>
  <p>
   about coughing up what she had already swallowed, she decided to treat them like
  </p>
  <p>
   enemy cities, that is to say, she left them pillaged and in ruins, and she went off with me
  </p>
  <p>
   439
  </p>
  <p>
   over to the kingdom of Geryon.”183 “Well played,” said the ship’s captain, “and you
  </p>
  <p>
   should not have done otherwise. By god, those men can go hire professional mourners
  </p>
  <p>
   to sing a dirge to the money they want returned.”
  </p>
  <p>
   On board the same ship was a moneylender who held the highest rank among
  </p>
  <p>
   his own people, and who was so uncivil and rude that he seemed to have been born of
  </p>
  <p>
   incivility and annoyance itself. As if he himself had been among the lovers whom Nice
  </p>
  <p>
   had robbed and deceived, he immediately started speaking harsh words, in the bitterest
  </p>
  <p>
   of terms, against Nice and against the whole class of whores. “Why is it surprising,” he
  </p>
  <p>
   said, “if a woman—whose life is all about cheating other people and expelling them from
  </p>
  <p>
   their ancestral estates with flattery and enticements—acts treacherously, maliciously,
  </p>
  <p>
   wickedly, and greedily. A whore is like a giant abyss and a whirlpool of vices. A whore is
  </p>
  <p>
   a crop failure that robs a farm of its yield. She is a rock against which fortunes,
  </p>
  <p>
   reputation, and prosperity are dashed and shattered, especially those of young men.
  </p>
  <p>
   She is an abyss that seizes, exhausts, and devours farms and estates. She is a most
  </p>
  <p>
   dangerous sea that is never satiated with gifts or has her fill. On the contrary, the sea is
  </p>
  <p>
   hardly a whore’s equal in terms of greed. Things that flow into the sea stealthily retreat
  </p>
  <p>
   and flow back again, whereas whatever finds its way into a whore’s house disappears
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately, never to be seen again. Want to see for yourself? Throw this woman into
  </p>
  <p>
   the sea. As soon as she comes in contact with it, the sea will be wiped clean of its
  </p>
  <p>
   water, as if from its riches, and she will enrich herself with it; once she has depleted the
  </p>
  <p>
   sea, she will escape from it; and—still not satisfied—she will be greedy for more.”
  </p>
  <p>
   183 The kingdom of Spain. In Greek mythology Geryon was a three-headed giant who lived on the island
  </p>
  <p>
   of Erytheia in the far west of the Mediterranean. He was the son of Chrysaor and Callirrhoe and grandson
  </p>
  <p>
   of Medusa.
  </p>
  <p>
   440
  </p>
  <p>
   Ballio did not stand for this man’s arrogance and contempt. “What does this
  </p>
  <p>
   woman owe you?” he asked. “What goes through your mind that you can’t address her
  </p>
  <p>
   properly? Whoever accuses another of a shameful act needs to look at himself in the
  </p>
  <p>
   mirror. For example, not only are these things you describe applicable to a
  </p>
  <p>
   moneylender, but much more egregious things as well! If a whore is eager, you are
  </p>
  <p>
   greedy; if she is impudent, you are perfidious; if she is disgraceful, you are detestable; if
  </p>
  <p>
   she is a whirlpool, you are an abyss; if she is the sea, you are Orcus drawing everything
  </p>
  <p>
   into itself and never giving it back. You say that whatever is given to whores disappears,
  </p>
  <p>
   but your all-devouring money—money that you lend at crushing interest rates and that
  </p>
  <p>
   devours whatever it touches—does this more thoroughly. For when age, illness, or
  </p>
  <p>
   anything of this sort starts limiting a wretched whore’s earnings, the gold and silver that
  </p>
  <p>
   her lovers had heaped on her flies to you instead, and with added interest. But when
  </p>
  <p>
   someone doesn’t have sufficient means to pay back your crushing interest, what is paid
  </p>
  <p>
   out as interest and principal is taken away and sunk in your deepest pit, never to
  </p>
  <p>
   emerge again. Thus, if a whore is the sea, you are a whirlpool that swallows up the sea
  </p>
  <p>
   itself; if she is the ruin of young men, you are a furiously raging pestilence, equally
  </p>
  <p>
   dangerous to both.” The haughty and hot-tempered man did not stand for these fiery
  </p>
  <p>
   words that Ballio was brandishing at him, and he flared up violently showering arrogant
  </p>
  <p>
   and harsh insults on him. Ballio, who has never been afraid of anyone, along with his
  </p>
  <p>
   wife tried to fly at the old man’s face, but we didn’t let them. Indeed, there was no more
  </p>
  <p>
   difficult a task than keeping their hands off that most insolent moneylender.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once their quarrel had subsided, however, lightheartedness and joking ensued.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ship’s captain asked the painter if it would not be too much trouble to tell the story
  </p>
  <p>
   441
  </p>
  <p>
   of a certain foreign woman. The painter immediately said: “When I arrived at Aspis,184
  </p>
  <p>
   having been hired by a gentleman of that town to cover the walls of some public
  </p>
  <p>
   walkway with my paintings, Lyus that most famous Cynic philosopher—who holds
  </p>
  <p>
   humanistic pursuits in the greatest contempt and is the most zealous persecutor of
  </p>
  <p>
   vices—arrived at the same place. He proceeded to hold frequent assemblies before the
  </p>
  <p>
   people and to speak frankly about their wickedness and evil ways. When a certain
  </p>
  <p>
   nobleman of the town realized he was being especially singled out for reproach, he
  </p>
  <p>
   arranged for the man to be placed on a litter and expelled from the territory which he
  </p>
  <p>
   governed. The man departed that region in such a way, however, that he left behind a
  </p>
  <p>
   feeling of high esteem among the people for his virtue and integrity.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The following day, a foreign maiden entered the town dressed as a Vestal
  </p>
  <p>
   Virgin. She was not the type of young woman who lives her life apart from the crowd,
  </p>
  <p>
   pent up within the enclosure of common walls, but was the type who goes around freely
  </p>
  <p>
   wherever she likes, so she can demonstrate, without a doubt, that her chastity and her
  </p>
  <p>
   other praiseworthy habits can be maintained even during interactions with men. The
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden had an image of Minerva hanging around her neck that was like an amulet
  </p>
  <p>
   made of bronze. Because of this, she inspired high esteem in everyone for her chastity,
  </p>
  <p>
   which she increased even more by pretending to be the sister of that philosopher Lyus
  </p>
  <p>
   and telling everyone she had been on the worlds’ most famous pilgrimages. Indeed, she
  </p>
  <p>
   said she had journeyed as far as the Temple of Ceres in Enna, the Temple of Apollo at
  </p>
  <p>
   Delphi, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the Temple of Jupiter at Amun, the Temple
  </p>
  <p>
   of Zeus at Dodona, and, finally, that there was no place where the worship of any
  </p>
  <p>
   184 The Latin is Aspim, which is an anagram of the accusative form of Pisa.
  </p>
  <p>
   442
  </p>
  <p>
   immortal god was practiced that she had not visited, surveyed, or venerated in person.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, because of the great esteem and reputation the philosopher Lyus enjoyed
  </p>
  <p>
   among the people, and because of the pilgrimages the maiden had undertaken (which
  </p>
  <p>
   we have no other acquaintance of except what we have gleaned from monuments of
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin literature), it came about that she was greatly in demand. The noblewomen of the
  </p>
  <p>
   town competed for which one of them would be the first to receive her as a guest, have
  </p>
  <p>
   her over for dinner, invite her to sleep in her room—and even in her own bed—and they
  </p>
  <p>
   reckoned that some element of the maiden’s purity would rub off on them through
  </p>
  <p>
   contact with her body. What more can I say? It was considered the greatest
  </p>
  <p>
   accomplishment to spend the night with the maiden at least once, such that even those
  </p>
  <p>
   who did not succeed in doing so falsely boasted that they had. And (what will amaze
  </p>
  <p>
   you even more) she stayed several nights among the cloistered Vestals, with the most
  </p>
  <p>
   fervent blessing of their High Priestess. Finally, not wanting to ignore other cities, the
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden began to prepare for her departure, because she thought it only right that, for
  </p>
  <p>
   those women’s sake, they also got to share in her most chaste body. This caused a
  </p>
  <p>
   wellspring of wailing and weeping among the women of Aspis, who complained that
  </p>
  <p>
   their comfort was being taken away from them much sooner than seemed right. As a
  </p>
  <p>
   matter of fact, they proclaimed that they had not gotten their fill of her most delightful
  </p>
  <p>
   company.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But their complaints fell on deaf ears, and the maiden made her way to the next
  </p>
  <p>
   town over, called Basilicum, where a certain distinguished widow ordered the guards of
  </p>
  <p>
   the city gates, if they saw a maiden set foot in the town dressed in foreign attire, to bring
  </p>
  <p>
   her immediately to the widow’s house. This widow, easily the first among her fellow
  </p>
  <p>
   443
  </p>
  <p>
   citizens in terms of rank, wealth, and reputation, had various couches placed around her
  </p>
  <p>
   house for offering hospitality to foreign women, and she arranged for their feet to be
  </p>
  <p>
   washed, dinner to be served, and beds to be made up for them. The guards
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately recognized this extraordinary prodigy of virtue and brought her to the
  </p>
  <p>
   widow’s house. When the maiden recounted the kinship that bound her so closely with
  </p>
  <p>
   Lyus and the most celebrated pilgrimages she had undertaken, she was led over into
  </p>
  <p>
   the sight and company of that most pious widow. The widow was so delighted by the
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden’s chastity and most saintly words that she locked her young servant girl (who
  </p>
  <p>
   usually slept in a little cot at her feet) out that night, brought the foreign maiden into her
  </p>
  <p>
   room, and settled her in the servant girl’s cot. Around midnight, when the foreign
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden recognized, by the way the widow was clearing her throat (even though she
  </p>
  <p>
   could not see her), that sleep was far from the widow’s eyes, she began pretending, by
  </p>
  <p>
   making noises with her chattering teeth, that her whole body was shivering. When the
  </p>
  <p>
   widow asked what was wrong, she responded that she had been seized by an
  </p>
  <p>
   unexpected deadly fever and, because of that, a sudden chill had taken hold of her
  </p>
  <p>
   entire body. The widow, taken with pity, ordered her to come into her bed and to bring
  </p>
  <p>
   her blanket and other bedclothes with her. The maiden did not have to be asked twice;
  </p>
  <p>
   she immediately obeyed and climbed into the widow’s bed.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Before too long, sleep overcame the widow. Then an incredible thing happened.
  </p>
  <p>
   That most virtuous maiden suddenly transformed from a chaste virgin into a lecherous
  </p>
  <p>
   man, and, like a stud horse, tried to enter the sleeping widow. The widow was
  </p>
  <p>
   awakened by his attempts and said: ‘What’s all this?’ To which the stranger replied: ‘Put
  </p>
  <p>
   aside your fear immediately. As you can see, I am a man, and I go around cities
  </p>
  <p>
   444
  </p>
  <p>
   dressed like this in order to fulfill the inclinations of women, who are inflamed with desire
  </p>
  <p>
   but kept on the straight and narrow by their anxiety about their neighbors and their
  </p>
  <p>
   reputation.’ And what do you think that most excellent woman did, now that she was
  </p>
  <p>
   caught between a rock and a hard place? What did she resolve to do? Did she perhaps
  </p>
  <p>
   lose courage or do what might occur to some foolish women, that is, raise a shout or
  </p>
  <p>
   ask for the protection of her fellow citizens, so that her neighbors would come running?
  </p>
  <p>
   None of the above. Instead she laughed and said: ‘Good for you. May the gods bestow
  </p>
  <p>
   many blessings on you in exchange for this compassion toward our fair sex. I hope you
  </p>
  <p>
   do not mind waiting here for a bit while I go wash up. It has been a while since I have
  </p>
  <p>
   had a bath, and even back in the old days I was not accustomed to give my attentions
  </p>
  <p>
   to a man unless I had bathed. At the same time, I will send my servant girl as far away
  </p>
  <p>
   from here as possible, so she doesn’t notice anything or tell on us. Then I will return to
  </p>
  <p>
   you, so I can seize this most delightful opportunity that has fallen into my lap.’ She
  </p>
  <p>
   jumped down from the bed, conferred with her maidservant, ordered her to go wake up
  </p>
  <p>
   a member of her household who, dressed only in his underwear and slippers (so as not
  </p>
  <p>
   lose any time putting on the rest of his clothes), ran to the judge and begged him, upon
  </p>
  <p>
   his word, to send a cohort of lictors to his house, insisting that the matter was
  </p>
  <p>
   scandalous, disgraceful, and merited his coming straightaway. The judge did not delay,
  </p>
  <p>
   and he ordered the lictors to go to the widow’s house. They arrived and seized the
  </p>
  <p>
   trickster and dragged him off to jail. To make a long story short, once the inquiry was
  </p>
  <p>
   concluded, he was handed over, dressed in rags, to his punishment—that is to say, his
  </p>
  <p>
   life was ended by hanging.
  </p>
  <p>
   445
  </p>
  <p>
   “When the news of this event reached us, in order to confirm it, I made my way
  </p>
  <p>
   secretly to Basilicum. While returning from there to Aspis, whenever I saw any of those
  </p>
  <p>
   men, whose wives were boasting that they had been worthy of receiving that pillar of
  </p>
  <p>
   virtue and honor into their bed, of kissing her and caressing her, I would immediately
  </p>
  <p>
   say: ‘Aren’t you lucky that so much good fortune entered your house?’ The man would
  </p>
  <p>
   deny that it happened, and I would insist; but he would refuse to acknowledge it,
  </p>
  <p>
   because he didn’t want to make me jealous. Keeping up the same pretense, I insisted
  </p>
  <p>
   that I regretted nothing more than that I had not drawn her beautiful image on many
  </p>
  <p>
   canvasses and sold them. For, I said, on account of the number of buyers, and on
  </p>
  <p>
   account of your loyalty toward that most beautiful maiden, I would have enough work for
  </p>
  <p>
   the entire year; and, because of that, I would have earned a huge amount of money in a
  </p>
  <p>
   short period of time. In sum, nobody could be found who was willing to admit that the
  </p>
  <p>
   trickster had set foot in his house.” That delightful story of the trickster was received as
  </p>
  <p>
   attentively as it was cheerfully, because he had discovered how to possess women
  </p>
  <p>
   (who are everywhere)—and everyone would have envied that man for his success, if it
  </p>
  <p>
   could only have lasted longer.

  <p>
   The strong wind we had very much been hoping for was already carrying us off
  </p>
  <p>
   to sea, and we were so enjoying the placid and tranquil water that, as Pacuvius once
  </p>
  <p>
   said regarding the Greek army, we were happily observing the fish at play.185 Then,
  </p>
  <p>
   suddenly, the weather turned foul and we were driven back to the same place we had
  </p>
  <p>
   departed from. I believe that Neptune had churned up those waves because he could

  </p>
  <p>
   446
  </p>
  <p>
   not tolerate the contempt and arrogance of a certain old man named Ligurinus186 who
  </p>
  <p>
   was traveling with us. Peevish and fastidious beyond belief, every little thing bothered
  </p>
  <p>
   this man: flying birds, the whistling wind, and the sound of oarsmen straining to catch
  </p>
  <p>
   their breath. He even threatened to have the oarsmen crucified if they breathed in such
  </p>
  <p>
   a way that any sound they made reached his ears. Ligurinus, together with his servant,
  </p>
  <p>
   chased a fly throughout the entire ship because it had buzzed in his ear while he was
  </p>
  <p>
   sleeping. I do not want to go on and on, so I am leaving out many other things that
  </p>
  <p>
   caused us to feel such hatred for him that it just about did us in. Once we had been sent
  </p>
  <p>
   back to shore, as I said, we got the ship’s captain to agree to let us go see Gallonius—
  </p>
  <p>
   which he was reluctant to do, since he said he wanted to set sail as soon as the
  </p>
  <p>
   contrary wind subsided and not wait until the following day. Because of this, he wanted
  </p>
  <p>
   us to return quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
   We arrived at Gallonius’s villa without delay via a narrow street that led straight
  </p>
  <p>
   there. As soon as Gallonius saw us, he reckoned that there was some more serious
  </p>
  <p>
   reason for our coming back and, after sending Plusius Accipiter away (whom we
  </p>
  <p>
   mentioned above), he insisted on knowing the cause of our return. We told him about
  </p>
  <p>
   the weather taking a turn for the worse as well as about Ligurinus’s annoying disregard
  </p>
  <p>
   for others. I said to him: “If we have to sail with that man again, we won’t need an
  </p>
  <p>
   executioner to finish us off. Ligurinus will just about deprive us of our lives by his
  </p>
  <p>
   hatefulness before we are even able to see the port.” “Do not be astonished,” said
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius. “He is equally offensive to everyone he lives with, both on land and on sea.
  </p>
  <p>
   186 IJsewijn (Eud. 1998 Lib. VII, n. 2) suggests that this pseudonym was inspired by the Ligurinus
  </p>
  <p>
   referenced in Hor. Carm. IV.10.5. Because Rossi’s Ligurinus is a peevish old man, it is fitting that the
  </p>
  <p>
   poem from which his name derives is about the transience of youth and beauty.
  </p>
  <p>
   447
  </p>
  <p>
   Just so you know, the neighborhood where he recently lived has been praying for his
  </p>
  <p>
   departure, or better yet, for his demise. He had all of the roosters around his house
  </p>
  <p>
   captured and killed because they sometimes deafened him while he was trying to get
  </p>
  <p>
   things done during the day. Moreover, he wounded a remarkable dog with a stone from
  </p>
  <p>
   a catapult, whom everyone adored on account of its good nature, and who kept thieves
  </p>
  <p>
   away by barking. He justified himself by saying that the dog had kept him awake while
  </p>
  <p>
   he was trying to sleep.187 But the truth is that he is hateful, cruel, harsh, and a monster.
  </p>
  <p>
   Did he not chase after a little owl, for many nights in a row, that was hooting at the
  </p>
  <p>
   window of the room where he slept, because he said it was an omen-bringing bird that
  </p>
  <p>
   was constantly foretelling an unhappy fate for him? So, after much effort, he caught the
  </p>
  <p>
   owl in a trap and killed it, and he had its head mounted on a spear in his villa as a
  </p>
  <p>
   trophy. But there is nothing to this man, as you know, besides his physical height, the
  </p>
  <p>
   splendor of his lineage, and his supreme arrogance. He was even wealthy once upon a
  </p>
  <p>
   time, but he was recently cleaned out of his possessions at sea and is now a worthless
  </p>
  <p>
   man, or rather, a no-account brute. Let him go, let him sail away. I pray to the gods that
  </p>
  <p>
   his voyage lasts forever!”
  </p>
  <p>
   He continued: “I believe I have reconciled Plusius Accipiter with Offuscatus.”188
  </p>
  <p>
   “What?” I said. “Was there hostility between them?” “A great deal,” he responded. “They
  </p>
  <p>
   187 Urban VIII was supposed to have had all of the birds killed in the gardens of the Palazzo Barberini on
  </p>
  <p>
   the Quirinale because their singing disturbed his sleep (Shea and Artigas 2003: 136); it is doubtful,
  </p>
  <p>
   however, that Rossi would have dared such a direct attack on the Pope, particularly since he calls this
  </p>
  <p>
   man “hateful, cruel, harsh, and a monster.”
  </p>
  <p>
   188 Antonio Bosio (1575/76-1629) was a scholar and archaeologist who was the first to carry out a
  </p>
  <p>
   systematic exploration of Rome’s catacombs. His book Roma sotterranea was completed after he died by
  </p>
  <p>
   Giovanni Severani and published by Guglielmo Faccioti in 1632. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 5.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerboni (1899: 124) identifies this Offuscatus as Giovanni Zaratino Castellini, mistaking this character for
  </p>
  <p>
   the character by the same name who appears in Book Three (see Chapter 3, n. 94). Rossi devotes a
  </p>
  <p>
   portrait to Bosio in his Pinacotheca.

  <p>
   were mortal enemies. There are many twisting catacombs on the outskirts of Rome that
  </p>
  <p>
   are like the mazy windings and curves of a labyrinth.189 The forefathers of these men,
  </p>
  <p>
   very observant people, used to meet secretly in these subterranean tunnels to perform
  </p>
  <p>
   sacred rites to Ceres and Liber because it was not permitted to do so openly. Even now
  </p>
  <p>
   quite a few traces of their religious practices can be seen in these places. As you know,
  </p>
  <p>
   Offuscatus is a scholar of these antiquities. He often puts his other responsibilities aside
  </p>
  <p>
   and retreats underground where he spends entire days and nights joyfully examining
  </p>
  <p>
   these most religious sites. Plusius, who has squandered his estate on drink, food, and
  </p>
  <p>
   whores—and who wishes to find some way, if he can, by which he can be restored to
  </p>
  <p>
   his previous lifestyle—has convinced himself that Offuscatus visits these sunken
  </p>
  <p>
   underground places because of some great advantage, that is, that he is engaged in
  </p>
  <p>
   digging up treasures and employing the magical arts in this quest. Thus, Plusius
  </p>
  <p>
   reckoned that he could accumulate enormous wealth if Offuscatus took him on as a
  </p>
  <p>
   partner. And he didn’t fail in this endeavor. One day he tracked Offuscatus down,
  </p>
  <p>
   grabbed his hand, and took him aside saying: ‘Please tell me what business you have
  </p>
  <p>
   underground. Why do you spend your life in the catacombs?’ Offuscatus replied: ‘Why
  </p>
  <p>
   do you think? I enjoy becoming thoroughly acquainted with the religious rites of our
  </p>
  <p>
   ancestors.’ Plusius replied: ‘Oh be quiet! It is as if we were meeting each other for the
  </p>
  <p>
   first time. I have never known you to practice religious observance. No, you are getting
  </p>
  <p>
   rich by treasure hunting.’ Offuscatus replied: ‘What is going through your mind that you
  </p>
  <p>
   believe our ancestors, who embraced uprightness instead of opulence and duty instead
  </p>
  <p>
   189 The Latin is labyrintheis flexibus; the translation “mazy windings of a labyrinth” is from the translation
  </p>
  <p>
   of Cat. 64.115 in Catullus and Cornish 1914.
  </p>
  <p>
   449
  </p>
  <p>
   of riches, had any treasure?’ ‘It’s no use,’ said Plusius. ‘I am not such a stranger to—or
  </p>
  <p>
   so uneducated in—our history books that I have not read that our pious ancestors used
  </p>
  <p>
   to offer libations to the gods with golden goblets and use candles in silver candelabras
  </p>
  <p>
   for their nocturnal orgies. Therefore, in the name of our friendship, take me on as a
  </p>
  <p>
   partner. I am eager to claim for myself some part of this most attractive enterprise.’
  </p>
  <p>
   “Offuscatus, familiar with Plusius’s capriciousness, believed that this delightful
  </p>
  <p>
   pastime offered him every satisfaction and leisure, and he was determined not to give it
  </p>
  <p>
   up for any reason. First, he began asking and imploring Plusius not to report him, since
  </p>
  <p>
   the practice of magical arts was a capital offense. He said: ‘If you love me, if my well-
  </p>
  <p>
   being is important to you, do not know what you know and do not see what you are
  </p>
  <p>
   seeing. What you are asking for, to take you on as my partner, that role in this
  </p>
  <p>
   enterprise is not mine. That belongs to our friend Stylius,190 who lives about one
  </p>
  <p>
   hundred miles away. However, because of your station I will make sure he travels that
  </p>
  <p>
   distance in less than three hours and meets us at the Temple of Janus Quadrifrons.191
  </p>
  <p>
   By god, I am pleased that you have given me this opportunity. I want to pay him back
  </p>
  <p>
   for dragging me, with his magic spells, from my hometown to this city in five hours.’ ‘Oh!’
  </p>
  <p>
   exclaimed Plusius, ‘If you could make that happen, you are surely a great man.’ ‘I’m
  </p>
  <p>
   begging you,’ replied Offuscatus, ‘keep your voice down! Do not shout. Go home and
  </p>
  <p>
   make sure that you are waiting for me at the Temple of Janus Quadrifrons when I need

   191 Possibly a reference to St. John Lateran Archbasilica, though the Arch of Janus is a fourth century CE
  </p>
  <p>
   arch that is still located at the northeastern edge of the Forum Boarium; it was once thought to have been
  </p>
  <p>
   a temple.
  </p>
  <p>
   450
  </p>
  <p>
   you. I will be there with a flattened nail’192 He had seen a very old copper nail in Aridus’s
  </p>
  <p>
   study, which, because it had certain letters and markings stamped on it, seemed
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly suitable for tricking Plusius, who was eager to experience magic. In the
  </p>
  <p>
   meantime, Offuscatus hurried to the palace of Stylius, who had returned from his
  </p>
  <p>
   hometown the day before. Offuscatus had told him about Plusius’s stupidity, and he
  </p>
  <p>
   explained how he wanted to play a trick on him. Between them they agreed that Stylius
  </p>
  <p>
   would show up in front of the Temple of Janus Quadrifrons at eleven o’clock that day
  </p>
  <p>
   dressed in leggings, as if he had just entered the city at that very moment. He would
  </p>
  <p>
   then scold Offuscatus for having had to drag himself to the city in under three hours.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Plusius arrived at Offuscatus’s house earlier than had been asked of him, and
  </p>
  <p>
   he urged and insisted that they get going, saying that nothing seemed to him more
  </p>
  <p>
   tedious than waiting to dig up a room full of gold from some old tomb. They set off, and
  </p>
  <p>
   they arrived. Offuscatus fixed the flattened nail in the ground inside the Temple of Janus
  </p>
  <p>
   Quadrifrons, to the left of the right-hand corner, using certain solemn words that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   just made up. Next, he hung a small piece of paper tied with yarn around Plusius’s
  </p>
  <p>
   neck, on which were written the letters PP, CC, and R. Listening to this tale, we asked
  </p>
  <p>
   Offuscatus what the letters meant, and he said: ‘Plusius Perdidit Cerebrum Cum Re’
  </p>
  <p>
   (‘Plusius has lost his mind together with his possessions’). He instructed Plusius that, if
  </p>
  <p>
   he ever wanted to return home from the spirit world safely and with his head still
  </p>
  <p>
   attached, he should never take the piece of paper off, but should let it hang around his
  </p>
  <p>
   neck forever like an amulet. Then they started walking, and after they had traveled a
  </p>
  <p>
   192 Fixing nails (specifically the “clavus annalis”) into the walls of a temple was a ritualistic way of marking
  </p>
  <p>
   time, and “clavum figere” (“to drive a nail”) was a proverbial expression meaning that something was
  </p>
  <p>
   sealed by fate (Cornish 1898: 178). Rossi also mentions Janus Quadrifons and a “clavus laminalis” in a
  </p>
  <p>
   1631 letter to Giovanni Zaratino Castellini (Ep. ad div. 1.III.XVII).
  </p>
  <p>
   451
  </p>
  <p>
   long distance Stylius appeared. Plusius saw him first and cheerfully called out to him:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘He’s here!’ They went to meet him, congratulated him on returning, wished him well,
  </p>
  <p>
   and invited him to dinner. But Stylius, feigning agitation, said: ‘Offuscatus, are you really
  </p>
  <p>
   toying with me in the same way I toyed with you? I don’t have cause to be angry with
  </p>
  <p>
   you, since I also teased you in the same way once.’ While Stylus was speaking, Plusius
  </p>
  <p>
   approached Offuscatus and said quietly: ‘Oh, great and outstanding man! Oh, you
  </p>
  <p>
   remarkable and well-nigh divine person!’ After the men had greeted each other
  </p>
  <p>
   extensively, Plusius and Offuscatus went to join Stylius. When Plusius saw in the street
  </p>
  <p>
   (where everyone was looking at Stylius) that they were coming up to him and were
  </p>
  <p>
   happy that he had arrived safely, he was amazed, jabbed Offuscatus in the side, and
  </p>
  <p>
   said in his ear: ‘You are the best!’ Offuscatus, pretending to be annoyed, said: ‘Stop
  </p>
  <p>
   talking, or you will have me destroyed.’ Then Plusius said: ‘Don’t be scared. Would I
  </p>
  <p>
   have someone killed who is my dearest friend and gifted with such virtue? I would rather
  </p>
  <p>
   die myself!’ To make a long story short, Plusius had so convinced himself that these
  </p>
  <p>
   things were true, that he would not have traded the wealth of Croesus with the treasures
  </p>
  <p>
   that the Manes had shown him.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But Plusius was a gossip, and he could not stop himself from disclosing the
  </p>
  <p>
   whole matter to a certain friend of his who knew Stylius very well (this man had, in fact,
  </p>
  <p>
   seen Stylius the day before Plusius came to tell him everything he had seen). This
  </p>
  <p>
   friend immediately realized that Plusius had been tricked, and he began to chide him
  </p>
  <p>
   harshly that a man his age, endowed with his sharp intellect, had allowed himself to be
  </p>
  <p>
   made a fool of by two young men. He said that, if Plusius insisted on believing them, he
  </p>
  <p>
   would soon have boys chasing after him with rocks. When Plusius heard this, he
  </p>
  <p>
   452
  </p>
  <p>
   became so enraged that he almost spit flames out of his mouth. He grabbed a dagger,
  </p>
  <p>
   threatened Offuscatus in absentia, and even claimed that he was going to kill him in the
  </p>
  <p>
   middle of the forum. Because I had been appointed as a go-between, I went to placate
  </p>
  <p>
   him, and I had barely begun speaking to him about his conditions for a peace accord
  </p>
  <p>
   when he cut me off saying: ‘Silence! I should go back to being on good terms with that
  </p>
  <p>
   man? May the gods destroy me if he is ever my friend again! Besides, he has already
  </p>
  <p>
   broken off our friendship. Let him find someone else to deceive.’ When I saw that this
  </p>
  <p>
   avenue was closed to me, I began to approach him via a different route saying: ‘Look,
  </p>
  <p>
   this stubbornness of yours is harming you rather than your enemy. Don’t you know how
  </p>
  <p>
   much drink, satiety, and happiness you are depriving yourself of? He promised that, if I
  </p>
  <p>
   could reconcile you with him, he would throw you a sumptuous dinner today in whatever
  </p>
  <p>
   locale you wish.’ And this plan did not fail. The mention of a restaurant and dinner had
  </p>
  <p>
   barely been introduced when that man, desirous of dinner on someone else’s dime
  </p>
  <p>
   (and, most of all, a glutton), did us the courtesy of ceasing his anger and promised to
  </p>
  <p>
   yield to our wishes.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But I must hurry over to the bookshop of Thaumantius,193 where the majority of
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars gather. They say that a famous philosopher will be there, whom you have not
  </p>
  <p>
   met. He has a remarkable mind, possesses the highest knowledge of human and divine
  </p>
  <p>
   matters, an outstanding oratorical ability, and a clearly prodigious memory besides. He
  </p>
  <p>
   acquired the sobriquet Teras194 and now that is what everyone calls him. He oversees
  </p>
  <p>
   193 Giovanni Battista Tamantini, a Roman bookseller. IJsewijn (Eud. 1998, VII n. 7) refers to Rossi’s
  </p>
  <p>
   mention of “Thaumantinus, nobilis bibliopola, qui officinam librariam habet Romae e regione Pasquini,
  </p>
  <p>
   sub solis signo” (Ep. ad div. 1.IV.XVI). For more information on Tamantini see Introduction n. 73.
  </p>
  <p>
   194 This pseudonym derives from the Greek word τέρας (wonder, prodigy, or marvel) and refers to Niccolò
  </p>
  <p>
   Riccardi (1585-1639) an Italian Dominican theologian, preacher, writer, and member of the Accademia
  </p>
  <p>
   degli Umoristi. On account of his marvelous eloquence, Philip III of Spain called him “The Marvel,” and he
  </p>
  <p>
   453
  </p>
  <p>
   the booksellers, and no type of literature can be published, sold, or imported into this
  </p>
  <p>
   city without his permission. I am going to ask him if he will grant my friend, whom you
  </p>
  <p>
   see here, leave to publish a certain notable book. And since the shop is close to the
  </p>
  <p>
   port, I do not think it incongruous with your plans to go there; it will cause you no delay
  </p>
  <p>
   when you receive word that the ship is setting sail.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Then his friend, who was going to publish the book, said: “Now that you’ve
  </p>
  <p>
   mentioned Plusius, if it does not cause offense, I want to tell you how he was recently
  </p>
  <p>
   cheated by two tricksters out of a few gold coins, which he had saved as his only
  </p>
  <p>
   defense against poverty in the face of an extreme emergency. These tricksters I was
  </p>
  <p>
   telling you about, they enlisted a boy of outstanding beauty, bent him to their will
  </p>
  <p>
   through sex, and then they thoroughly trained him in every manner of deceit and trickery
  </p>
  <p>
   for their own enrichment. They told him to walk ahead of them in the streets and in the
  </p>
  <p>
   town squares, and they stealthily followed close behind him as he walked ahead. As he
  </p>
  <p>
   had been instructed, the boy greeted any man he came across, who he judged from
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances not to be averse to sleeping with boys. The boy would then ask this man
  </p>
  <p>
   to point him toward someone who could take him into his service; and said that he
  </p>
  <p>
   himself, who held the highest rank among his own people, had been humiliated by his
  </p>
  <p>
   father’s brutality to the point that he had run away from home; that he was struggling
  </p>
  <p>
   under the greatest poverty; and that he had already gone a whole day without food.
  </p>
  <p>
   That man then, taken both with pity and with the boy’s beauty, would direct the boy to
  </p>
  <p>
   subsequently became known by that name in Spain and Italy (Gerboni 1899: 132; see also Eud. 1998, VII
  </p>
  <p>
   n. 8.). Riccardi was a consultant to the Congregation of the Index and, in 1629, he was appointed Master
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Sacred Palace, the Vatican’s censor. His duties in these roles—deciding which titles could be
  </p>
  <p>
   printed, imported, and sold—are reflected in this passage. Rossi devotes a portrait to Riccardi in his
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   454
  </p>
  <p>
   follow him and, as soon as they went into the house, the tricksters would break in as
  </p>
  <p>
   well. When they arrived, the boy would untie his shoes as he had been instructed and
  </p>
  <p>
   allow his trousers to slip down around his feet. Then the tricksters would raise their
  </p>
  <p>
   voices yelling: ‘Are you seducing our little brother into such wickedness? Somebody call
  </p>
  <p>
   the lictors—they will tie this man up and drag him in front of the tresviri!’195 (It is
  </p>
  <p>
   considered a great sin in Eudemia to have sex with freeborn boys.) The other one would
  </p>
  <p>
   say: ‘Why do we need lictors? I will perform the role of lictor, judge, and executioner,
  </p>
  <p>
   and I will kill this pervert myself, as he deserves!’ Then, turning back toward the boy,
  </p>
  <p>
   and with a certain paternal severity, he would say: ‘Aren’t you ashamed to sully our
  </p>
  <p>
   family name with such a manifest stain? Tell me, what has driven you to this depravity?
  </p>
  <p>
   Was it hunger? Was there not enough for you to eat and drink at home? Go home, you
  </p>
  <p>
   scoundrel! May Jove always be angry with me if I do not strip the clothes off your back
  </p>
  <p>
   with switches!’ The poor man, caught between a rock and a hard place, would be forced
  </p>
  <p>
   to pay a ransom in order to escape a trial or death.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Many men become caught up in this net, but there is one in particular, from
  </p>
  <p>
   among the great rank of philosophers, whom it is not necessary for me to mention.196
  </p>
  <p>
   The man had to endure his soft cloak, linen clothes, and many gold coins besides,
  </p>
  <p>
   being stripped from him, in order to free himself after being caught in that trap. Another
  </p>
  <p>
   man, who was otherwise good and sensible, and had been drawn into this fraud by the
  </p>
  <p>
   charms of a boy, was not only forced to hand over his money on the spot, but also had
  </p>
  <p>
   195 Tresviri, or triumviri: a body of three officials or commissioners, who held a joint office and oversaw
  </p>
  <p>
   various aspects of public business.
  </p>
  <p>
   196 This individual is not identified but this vignette implies that entrapment was a risk that men (in this
  </p>
  <p>
   case a priest) ran when seeking out sexual encounters with other men, resulting in the person being
  </p>
  <p>
   vulnerable to blackmail.
  </p>
  <p>
   455
  </p>
  <p>
   to promise, if he did not want to be exposed, to toss six drachma coins at the tricksters’
  </p>
  <p>
   feet every time they saw him—which they made sure happened on just about a daily
  </p>
  <p>
   basis. Plusius, therefore, since his proclivities tended in this direction (his mother and
  </p>
  <p>
   his wife frequently caught him inside a boy and beat him badly with their sandals),
  </p>
  <p>
   rushed to them like a starving fish seeking food in this trap. Deceiving him in this same
  </p>
  <p>
   way, the tricksters stripped him of all the gold he had.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While we were talking, we arrived at Thaumantius’s shop and saw many people
  </p>
  <p>
   sitting around on chairs. One of them, who was a bit overweight and had a big head,
  </p>
  <p>
   blonde hair, and a ruddy complexion, was reciting who-knows-what kind of verses to
  </p>
  <p>
   another man sitting next to him. They said that the man’s name was Fuscus197 and that
  </p>
  <p>
   he had recently published certain letters of Heroides after Ovid’s example. Two other
  </p>
  <p>
   men were talking between themselves about a certain young man, named Pusillus
  </p>
  <p>
   Caesar,198 who had died very recently from consumption, and they were comparing him
  </p>
  <p>
   with another young man in terms of the magnitude of his intellect, his knowledge of the
  </p>
  <p>
   greatest subjects, and his refinement in each course of study. That second young man,
  </p>
  <p>
   learned to the point of being a miracle, rushed through his course of study and died
  </p>
  <p>
   when he was just a little bit older, in the very flower of his youth. A certain Uranius199
  </p>
  <p>
   was also sitting among them, who was awarded the highest praise by everyone for his
  </p>
  <p>
   painting, and he was granted first place, by the consensus of all, especially in drawing.
  </p>
  <p>
   197 Antonio Bruni (1593-1635) published a translation of Ovid’s Heroides titled Epistole Eroiche libri due
  </p>
  <p>
   (Milan: 1626; Rome: Mascardi, 1634; and various subsequent editions). See also Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n.
  </p>
  <p>
   11. Rossi devotes a portrait to Bruni in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   198 Virginio Cesarini (1695-1524), also referred to as Virgilio, was an accomplished Italian intellectual and
  </p>
  <p>
   poet who died at the age of twenty-nine. Rossi devotes a portrait to Cesarini in his Pinacoteca.
  </p>
  <p>
   199 Gaspare Celio (1571-1640) was a painter, writer, mathematician, and architect. Rossi devotes a
  </p>
  <p>
   portrait to Celio in his Pinacotheca.
  </p>
  <p>
   456
  </p>
  <p>
   And he did not move in those circles of literary men solely by dint of his painting, but
  </p>
  <p>
   because he was also gifted in letters. It was well known that he was an astronomer, a
  </p>
  <p>
   mathematician, and a poet, and that he not only surpassed many of his contemporaries
  </p>
  <p>
   in terms of his keenness of wit and inventiveness, but many men from previous eras as
  </p>
  <p>
   well. (There were a few people who did try to detract from his praise because of certain
  </p>
  <p>
   jealousies.) Letters were delivered to Uranius from Aridus, in which he complained of a
  </p>
  <p>
   wrongdoing by a certain old man named Merlinus, who, without being asked or
  </p>
  <p>
   compelled, had sent him vinegar on a whim instead of aged wine with a bouquet. They
  </p>
  <p>
   said that he was a hateful old man, wicked, annoying, stingy, rude, filthy, and that he
  </p>
  <p>
   returned home to his wife every day with his trousers soaked in urine and feces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Uranius read these letters out loud over and over, in a clear and distinct voice, which
  </p>
  <p>
   made it so that even I was able to memorize them. I recorded them in my notebook so
  </p>
  <p>
   they wouldn’t be lost:
  </p>
  <p>
   Farewell, nourishing light of artists, to whom sweet Phoebus granted
  </p>
  <p>
   songs and on whom he bestowed Urania’s shining fame. Listen to how
  </p>
  <p>
   Merlinus made fun of me, that rotten, evil, decrepit old man. He ran into
  </p>
  <p>
   me on the Janiculum Hill and recounted the following in a trembling voice:
  </p>
  <p>
   “In case you are unaware, I have some wine that could surpass the nectar
  </p>
  <p>
   of the gods and draw Jove down from heaven above.” He asks, insists,
  </p>
  <p>
   and calls upon me not to refuse his gift and to drink down the clear wine
  </p>
  <p>
   from his full wine jugs. When that shameless man said those words to me,
  </p>
  <p>
   harsh thirst happened to be burning my miserable throat. I do not delay
  </p>
  <p>
   but send an empty bottle along with him, which he generously returns to
  </p>
  <p>
   me full. Believe me, it was poison, not wine, there is any fouler wine on
  </p>
  <p>
   earth. Having decided to entrust the wine to my empty veins, and
  </p>
  <p>
   banishing the insatiable thirst from my dry mouth, a dreadful cold shot
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately into my very bones, my throat closed up, and I almost died.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nevertheless, his ghastly household restores itself with Merlin’s drink,
  </p>
  <p>
   giving it pride of place above sweet ambrosia. You ask why his wife,
  </p>
  <p>
   457
  </p>
  <p>
   sister, servant, son, and nephew enjoy such cold vinegar.200 Because, of
  </p>
  <p>
   course, it serves to fortify their stomachs so they don’t vomit their guts up
  </p>
  <p>
   as soon as that Merlin, caked in snot and stinking feces, carries his dire
  </p>
  <p>
   poison to their noses and stomachs.

  <p>
   When he had finished reading, everyone burst out laughing. Then another man
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “Listen to another absurdity of this comic and silly old man, or rather, a disgraceful
  </p>
  <p>
   act worthy of punishment. While he was in Dynast Bibulus’s antechamber a few days
  </p>
  <p>
   ago—along with many other men who were waiting to be admitted in to see Bibulus—he
  </p>
  <p>
   caught sight of an attractive and well-bred young man. Leaving everyone else behind,
  </p>
  <p>
   he sought this young man out, approached him, asked how he was, if he was well, and
  </p>
  <p>
   whether he often consorted with prostitutes. He said that now was the time of life for
  </p>
  <p>
   that sort of activity, and he advised him to keep in mind that he would not always be as
  </p>
  <p>
   young as he was then. The young man responded that he was doing well physically but
  </p>
  <p>
   not so well financially, and because of that he was hardly able to afford a prostitute.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merlinus said: ‘This is what is keeping you from the greatest pleasure of all? Take heart!
  </p>
  <p>
   Find an object of your affection; as for the rest, I will assume responsibility for making
  </p>
  <p>
   sure you have the money. I too was young once, so I know what it’s like to be bursting
  </p>
  <p>
   with desire and not to have the means to pay for it. Because of this I am a pretty decent
  </p>
  <p>
   judge when it comes to young men.’ The young man replied: ‘I think I have found
  </p>
  <p>
   something to my liking, so make sure I have something to offer her. A young whore lives
  </p>
  <p>
   here next door. She is not unattractive and not unsuitable, and I had my heart set on her
  </p>
  <p>
   a long time ago. But she says that she will not rent herself out to me because she

  <p>
   knows that I don’t have even one penny to give her. If you like, I will show her to you
  </p>
  <p>
   when you have the time.’ ‘I am free now,’ said Merlinus. ‘Let’s go. I’m eager to procure
  </p>
  <p>
   the funds for you as soon as possible.’
  </p>
  <p>
   “They set off together and arrived at the house of a certain prostitute. They knock
  </p>
  <p>
   on the door. The prostitute opens. They go in. The young man asks for sex, she
  </p>
  <p>
   demands payment, and Merlinus acts as guarantor. While the boy is bedding the whore
  </p>
  <p>
   inside, Merlinus stands guard at the door in the meantime. He takes three drachmas out
  </p>
  <p>
   of his old purse and gives them to the whore as payment. The woman takes the money
  </p>
  <p>
   forlornly, since she had much higher hopes for Merlinus’s generosity, seeing as he was
  </p>
  <p>
   a rich man. However, when the young man came to her every day with three drachmas,
  </p>
  <p>
   and there was never any increase in payment, she could no longer hide her pain. She
  </p>
  <p>
   said to him: ‘As far as I can tell, you truly must think me a two-bit whore, because you
  </p>
  <p>
   are paying me such a small amount. But now, so that you know what I think, I am telling
  </p>
  <p>
   you that you won’t set foot in here anymore unless you add three more drachmas to
  </p>
  <p>
   your daily amount.’ Merlinus became angry and said: ‘Tell me, you dregs of society,
  </p>
  <p>
   how much time does it take to perform the service you are hiring yourself out to that
  </p>
  <p>
   young man for? Surely it is so little that it can hardly be measured with money. You
  </p>
  <p>
   can’t complain that three drachmas constitute poor compensation. As if I didn’t know
  </p>
  <p>
   that you usually sell these same services to others for one penny, or as if the product
  </p>
  <p>
   offered by whores is expensive. In fact, nothing is cheaper these days. We will go
  </p>
  <p>
   elsewhere, and we’ll shift the profit that you’re turning down to that other venue. It’s you
  </p>
  <p>
   who will truly be losing out.’”

  <p>

  <p>
   There was nobody in that gathering who did not hear, without laughing, about the
  </p>
  <p>
   generosity and pity of that smelly old man, who had one foot in the grave, toward that
  </p>
  <p>
   son of a miserly and hard-hearted father. Since one man was laughing more effusively
  </p>
  <p>
   than the others, this inspired the others to ask him what was so funny. When asked he
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “The servant carrying that letter from Aridus has reminded me of a ridiculous act,
  </p>
  <p>
   which I can easily say is the most delightful thing I have ever read or heard. At the time
  </p>
  <p>
   that schemer was engaged in service to Rufus the clerk (who later went bankrupt) and
  </p>
  <p>
   received ten drachmas from him every day for shopping expenses. But one day, while
  </p>
  <p>
   he was heading to the shops with his ten drachmas, as he was wont to do, he saw a
  </p>
  <p>
   man in the middle of the marketplace who, with the permission of the praetor, had an
  </p>
  <p>
   urn full of lottery tickets. Whoever wanted to try his luck would pay this man three
  </p>
  <p>
   drachmas to draw a ticket. The servant was seized with an enormous desire to test his
  </p>
  <p>
   luck, and he tried his fortune by spending three drachmas from the amount that his
  </p>
  <p>
   master had given him for the household errands. As it happened, he drew a winning
  </p>
  <p>
   ticket, one that got him a silver basin with a jug that was valued at ten minae. He turned
  </p>
  <p>
   down the basin and jug, and he accepted nine minae in cash instead (if you opt to take
  </p>
  <p>
   cash over your prize you receive the value of your prize, minus one tenth). After he had
  </p>
  <p>
   been given his money, he spent the remainder of the coins, which had been for the
  </p>
  <p>
   household shopping, in the tavern next door, not concerning himself with returning
  </p>
  <p>
   home.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Because he had been waiting many hours, and because it was already close to
  </p>
  <p>
   noon and his servant had not appeared, Rufus was angry since he had to pass the day
  </p>
  <p>
   with no lunch. He ordered his lictors to find and seize his servant and drag him off to jail.
  </p>
  <p>
   460
  </p>
  <p>
   From the money the servant had received in lieu of his prize he rented expensive
  </p>
  <p>
   clothing for himself from a costume designer,201 and he commanded two servants,
  </p>
  <p>
   dressed in colorful clothing, to follow him. Decked out in this splendid and magnificent
  </p>
  <p>
   manner, he took himself to Rufus’s chambers. But Rufus immediately saw through,
  </p>
  <p>
   recognized, and identified him, and got up and rushed straight at him. The servant
  </p>
  <p>
   strode toward Rufus at the same pace, came up close to him, and bid him good day.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the servant was asked to explain his ensemble, he responded that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   received an inheritance from a relative—a substantial one of forty talents, to be
  </p>
  <p>
   precise—and that it had fallen to him to accrue dignity to himself on account of both the
  </p>
  <p>
   windfall itself and the distinction of the amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Rufus, whose estate had begun falling into ruin, was roused by hope of a better
  </p>
  <p>
   fortune and said to himself quietly: ‘If this man is telling the truth, the gods are looking
  </p>
  <p>
   out for me. But it has to be true, otherwise why would it occur to him to make all this up
  </p>
  <p>
   when there is no profit in deceiving me?’ So he believed it, adopted new hope, and no
  </p>
  <p>
   longer reprimanded the man as a servant, but treated him instead with honor similar to
  </p>
  <p>
   how he would treat a master. Rufus walked on his left side in the street,202 put him up at
  </p>
  <p>
   his house, and, since he didn’t have any expensive furnishings, he rented him an
  </p>
  <p>
   embroidered silk bedspread and a silk canopy at very great expense. When Rufus
  </p>
  <p>
   thought he had sufficiently buttered the man up with flattery and gifts, he asked to
  </p>
  <p>
   201 The Latin word is choragus.
  </p>
  <p>
   202 The Latin phrase for walking on someone’s left side is “comes exterior ire,” which, in this context,
  </p>
  <p>
   “refers to the position of the sycophant or legacy-hunter, as protecting the rich individual, who in this
  </p>
  <p>
   sense is interior; and the left side was the one protected or guarded on such occasions, because it was
  </p>
  <p>
   considered the weaker of the two, and was also more exposed to injury or attack” (Horace, Anthon, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd 1837: 412 n. 17).
  </p>
  <p>
   461
  </p>
  <p>
   borrow four talents, which he promised to pay back soon. The very generous man said:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Why four? Ask for ten! I am happy to front you the money, and you can pay me back
  </p>
  <p>
   whenever it’s convenient.’ Barely containing himself for happiness, Rufus rejoiced and
  </p>
  <p>
   gave thanks to the gods for bringing such prompt aid to his hopeless and ruinous
  </p>
  <p>
   estate.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In order to keep the man more in his debt, and in order to compel him to keep
  </p>
  <p>
   his promise regarding the ten talents, Rufus took out a loan in the amount of fifty minae,
  </p>
  <p>
   with interest, and with it he put on an ample and magnificent feast. He invited Dynast
  </p>
  <p>
   Eugenius to dinner, who at that time was prospering in wealth and influence, and under
  </p>
  <p>
   whose patronage he received protection. He put on festive games and brought in comic
  </p>
  <p>
   actors to perform mimes. That scoundrel could be observed dining next to, and sitting
  </p>
  <p>
   by, that most important Dynast Eugenius and often whispering in his ear, as if he were
  </p>
  <p>
   his equal in splendor, dignity, and power. Such is the power of money. Need I say it?
  </p>
  <p>
   Rufus squandered the entirety of those fifty minae in less than five days. When that
  </p>
  <p>
   joker had, for some days now, stuffed himself to his heart’s content at Rufus’s full and
  </p>
  <p>
   abundant table, he steered his belly elsewhere, and on a certain day, stuffed from
  </p>
  <p>
   lunch, he departed the house. Evening came and the servant still had not returned. First
  </p>
  <p>
   one, then two, then three days passed, but he never appeared. Rufus—who was
  </p>
  <p>
   assuming that his ten talents had already been located and solidly nailed down in his
  </p>
  <p>
   house (and who would not have allowed a penny to be taken from him if a buyer
  </p>
  <p>
   appeared to purchase his debt)—now complained and lamented his bad luck and kept
  </p>
  <p>
   saying that it was because of his own stupidity that the ten talents had been snatched
  </p>
  <p>
   away, since he had not kept a close eye on the man.
  </p>
  <p>
   462
  </p>
  <p>
   “After eight days had passed, while Rufus was taking the statements of certain
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses under oath in his chambers, the servant appeared alone, tattered, and filthy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Someone recognized him and immediately pointed him out to Rufus as he was
  </p>
  <p>
   occupied with questioning the witnesses. Dropping everything, Rufus came down from
  </p>
  <p>
   his bench and asked the man where his colorfully dressed entourage was and where
  </p>
  <p>
   his expensive trousers and silk cloak had gone to. The man responded that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   given them back (as was proper) to the costume designer who had rented them to him.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time he calmly and slowly told Rufus about his windfall from the winning
  </p>
  <p>
   lottery ticket. He said that he was back now and could hire out his services at his usual
  </p>
  <p>
   rate. Rufus said: ‘So, what you said about the forty talents coming to you from the death
  </p>
  <p>
   of a relative, that was a lie?’ The joker said: ‘It is as true as if the sun shone at midnight
  </p>
  <p>
   or if the dead were alive.’ ‘Why did you lie?’ asked Rufus. The servant responded:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Because it was a way for me to experience what life is like for the noble and fortunate. I
  </p>
  <p>
   have indeed discovered that it is agreeable and pleasant. How much good there is in it!
  </p>
  <p>
   I should have been born rich; I would know how to enjoy myself and have fun!’ Furious,
  </p>
  <p>
   Rufus attacked the man head on and struck him with more than fifty blows and
  </p>
  <p>
   punches. But the servant, in turn, blocked the man from hitting his face. After he saw
  </p>
  <p>
   that Rufus had succumbed to fatigue with all of his yelling and beating he said: ‘Come
  </p>
  <p>
   now, let us put aside these trifles. Command me to go back to the house. What things
  </p>
  <p>
   do you need me to set out so that your lunch is ready for you?’ Feeling that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   doing more harm to himself by beating his servant, Rufus ceased and said: ‘He who
  </p>
  <p>
   beats a stone, loses his hand.’ At that point, he became more kindly disposed toward
  </p>
  <p>
   his servant and handed him the keys along with some money to go shopping with.”
  </p>
  <p>
   463
  </p>
  <p>
   Everyone was marvelously delighted at the servant’s actions, and they concluded
  </p>
  <p>
   that the man was an amusing storyteller and a skilled fabulist. Everyone had already
  </p>
  <p>
   fallen silent when Uranius the painter said: “Since it has very opportunely come to pass
  </p>
  <p>
   that I should come before this gathering of learned men, if it pleases you, I shall read
  </p>
  <p>
   you a short Phalaecian poem203 that I composed at the command of Bibulus, high priest
  </p>
  <p>
   of Father Liber. It praises a dove that the man loved and that died because of his kisses
  </p>
  <p>
   and embraces.” Although everyone said they wanted him to read it, he said “I will read
  </p>
  <p>
   the poem on one condition, that if it falters in any way, you let me know, or, better yet,
  </p>
  <p>
   you correct it. It will be carved in a plaque, in large marble letters, and affixed on a wall
  </p>
  <p>
   together with other epitaphs that can be seen there”:
  </p>
  <p>
   O, evil and wicked deed! Cruel death seeks out, with its all-devouring
  </p>
  <p>
   maw, anything anywhere that is pleasant and beautiful. It snatched my
  </p>
  <p>
   beautiful dove away from me, like it once most wickedly carried off the
  </p>
  <p>
   sweet sparrow from Catullus’s Lesbia and spoiled her bright cheeks with
  </p>
  <p>
   wretched tears. Alas, where has my pain transported me in my grief? And
  </p>
  <p>
   why do I protest the deeds of rapacious Orcus? He is not the one who
  </p>
  <p>
   ordered that crime. It is not the dark realms of Dis that hold her but lovely
  </p>
  <p>
   Venus, who now rejoices in yoking my beautiful dove to her own chariot.
  </p>
  <p>
   Everyone cheered: “Splendid! Excellent! Well done!” Then a certain person was
  </p>
  <p>
   asked—a person who, as was reported, was extremely witty, a very funny jokester with
  </p>
  <p>
   a mind as sharp as vinegar so he would not bear any indignity if he were attacked—he
  </p>
  <p>
   was asked, I say, to recite a poem that he had written against that ruined man
  </p>
  <p>
   Tigellus.204 “I will recite it,” he said, “only if it doesn’t cause you annoyance.” We replied:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Annoyance? We are the ones who asked you to recite it.” He said: “I got revenge on
  </p>
  <p>
   203 The Latin is Phalaecium carmen, which is a poetic form named for the ancient Greek poet Φάλαικος; it
  </p>
  <p>
   is hendecasyllabic consisting of a spondee, a dactyl, and three trochees.
  </p>
  <p>
   204 The name of a first century CE lyric poet who flourished during the time of Julius Caesar. He most
  </p>
  <p>
   famously appears in the first book of Hor. Sat. (I.II, I.III, I.IV, I.X).
  </p>
  <p>
   464
  </p>
  <p>
   the detestable greed of that horribly bankrupt Tigellus with this song. He treated his
  </p>
  <p>
   creditors like Hercules treated his own, as you well know.205 He gave them a tenth part,
  </p>
  <p>
   took a ninth part for himself, and, flush with the money he had taken from all quarters,
  </p>
  <p>
   he refused to contribute, along with his other neighbors, even a few coins toward the
  </p>
  <p>
   performance of a comic play”:
  </p>
  <p>
   When Tigellus, with savagery and a harsh glance, refuses to contribute
  </p>
  <p>
   two nummi for the play, do you marvel that such a stingy man once, as a
  </p>
  <p>
   castaway, crashed his boat against Janus Gate?206 You are wrong! He did
  </p>
  <p>
   not suffer the least bit of loss but committed huge crimes while feigning
  </p>
  <p>
   insolvency. To the person he owed one hundred thousand sesterces to,
  </p>
  <p>
   he said: “Either go hang yourself or accept ten!” And nobody dared utter a
  </p>
  <p>
   word, but every creditor left after willingly agreeing to his terms. What
  </p>
  <p>
   would you do if you had a sword hanging over your head? Would you
  </p>
  <p>
   yourself, begging for mercy, not surrender to the victor? Is whatever the
  </p>
  <p>
   thief leaves you with not a gain? Don’t you think that, in the end, even your
  </p>
  <p>
   life is his gift? Tigellus was not so much a fellow citizen as a bandit, and
  </p>
  <p>
   he considered whatever he did not steal from you to be a gift.
  </p>
  <p>
   He had barely recited the final syllable of his verses when someone intervened
  </p>
  <p>
   saying: “I am just coming from the forum where I was greatly astonished at the wisdom,
  </p>
  <p>
   justice, and fairness of judge Coschinus. Indeed, I was present in his courtroom for his
  </p>
  <p>
   ruling regarding a matter of private law. Neither Rhadamas nor Minos himself could
  </p>
  <p>
   have made a ruling that was more serious, grave, or fair than his.” He did not wait to be
  </p>
  <p>
   asked but, having gotten everyone’s attention, he began: “A widow was demanding
  </p>
  <p>
   payment of seventy minae that she had loaned, after much pleading on his part, to a
  </p>
  <p>
   neighbor of hers who was involved in purchasing certain merchandise. The neighbor
  </p>
  <p>
   had promised to pay the money back after four months, and he had signed a contract
  </p>
  <p>
   205 A reference to the practice of tithing to Hercules (see citation of Macrob. Sat. III.12 in Eud. 1998, Lib.
  </p>
  <p>
   VII n. 16).
  </p>
  <p>
   206 = lost everything; went bankrupt
  </p>
  <p>
   465
  </p>
  <p>
   by which, as she was declaring, he stipulated to this in writing. However, not only did
  </p>
  <p>
   the day never arrive when he paid the money back, but many more days went by
  </p>
  <p>
   without his making any further mention of it, as if he had never received it. The woman
  </p>
  <p>
   began demanding her money back, but he put her off day after day saying: ‘I will give it
  </p>
  <p>
   to you soon. In a little bit. Come back tomorrow. I don’t have time right now.’ When the
  </p>
  <p>
   woman saw that she kept being put off longer and longer, she approached the man and
  </p>
  <p>
   said: ‘Since you are playing games with me, I will claim the money you owe me via the
  </p>
  <p>
   law and a court ruling.’ Angered, he then said: ‘Do as you wish, I owe you nothing.’ So
  </p>
  <p>
   the woman hurried at full speed to the offices of a certain legal clerk where many
  </p>
  <p>
   scribes were working. She related her case to one of them and showed him the
  </p>
  <p>
   contract. After reading it he burst out laughing and told the woman to show it to his
  </p>
  <p>
   colleagues, who also burst out laughing. Seeing this, the woman said: ‘What is the
  </p>
  <p>
   meaning of this? Why are they laughing? In any case, if the seat and the province, so to
  </p>
  <p>
   speak, of the laughable is ugliness, I don’t see that I am so repulsive as to be laughed
  </p>
  <p>
   at.’ To make a long story short, she was sent in to see the clerk. After examining her
  </p>
  <p>
   case he realized that the woman had been had. ‘Don’t be surprised that you are being
  </p>
  <p>
   laughed at. You have been mightily deceived! That no-good debtor who gave you that
  </p>
  <p>
   promissory note only wrote down that verse from Horace’s Carmen saeculare: “Sing,
  </p>
  <p>
   young maidens, of Diana.”’207 At which point the woman cried, wailed, and implored the
  </p>
  <p>
   faith of gods and men. But the clerk said: ‘Stop your crying and go before judge
  </p>
  <p>
   207 This is not actually from the Carmen saeculare but is instead the first verse of Hor. Carm. I.21.1:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Dianam tenerae dicite virgines.” See also Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 18.
  </p>
  <p>
   466
  </p>
  <p>
   Coschinus instead. He has the authority and wisdom to find a solution that will expose
  </p>
  <p>
   that scoundrel’s fraud.’
  </p>
  <p>
   “The woman hurried away and arrived, out of breath, at the judge’s house just as
  </p>
  <p>
   he happened to be descending from the bench, after the court crier had dismissed the
  </p>
  <p>
   litigants. She approached him, complained about the wrong done to her, explained how
  </p>
  <p>
   she had been cleaned out of her dowry by that no-account debtor to whom she had
  </p>
  <p>
   given a loan for purchasing merchandise. She also showed him the purchases that the
  </p>
  <p>
   money had been used for, and she produced the promissory note that the fraudster had
  </p>
  <p>
   signed in lieu of collateral. After examining the case, the judge opined that the woman
  </p>
  <p>
   had most certainly been tricked. Truly moved, he told her to cheer up and to withdraw
  </p>
  <p>
   for the time being into the next room, while he summoned before him the man who had
  </p>
  <p>
   defrauded her. Accordingly, he sent someone to call him. When the man arrived the
  </p>
  <p>
   judge received him cordially, took him aside, and asked him how he was and if he was
  </p>
  <p>
   well, and he inquired whether he had made a profit off of the merchandise he had
  </p>
  <p>
   recently purchased. The man confirmed that the business dealings had turned out well
  </p>
  <p>
   in his hands. The judge then asked him whether he had repaid the loan he had taken
  </p>
  <p>
   out for that purpose. The man responded that he did indeed know the woman, but that
  </p>
  <p>
   he did not owe a penny either to her or to anyone else. The judge then produced the
  </p>
  <p>
   promissory note and asked whether the man recognized his signature. The man did not
  </p>
  <p>
   dare deny it but instead asked: ‘What does that pertain to?’ The judge replied: ‘To you
  </p>
  <p>
   repaying seventy minae immediately. If anyone else had done business with you, I
  </p>
  <p>
   would allow that person to act according to the rule and order of the law; and I would not
  </p>
  <p>
   rule against you until everything had been carried out according to the letter of the law.
  </p>
  <p>
   467
  </p>
  <p>
   However, since you must reckon with Diana and Apollo, you will not set foot outside of
  </p>
  <p>
   this chamber until you have sufficiently done right by them.’ While the man was shouting
  </p>
  <p>
   and saying that he was being oppressed by an unjust ruling, the judge said: ‘Somebody
  </p>
  <p>
   call the lictors to restrain this man, drag him off, and lock him up in a jail for religious
  </p>
  <p>
   offenders. At the same time, hitch the horses to my carriage. I have to visit the Rex
  </p>
  <p>
   Sacrorum208 to inform him about this man’s most wicked theft.’ The man was moved by
  </p>
  <p>
   fear of chains, dreading at the same time the ire of the Rex Sacrorum if such a manifest
  </p>
  <p>
   theft were to be brought before him. He successfully obtained, after much begging, that
  </p>
  <p>
   the judge allow him to make the woman whole, and, after sending men to retrieve the
  </p>
  <p>
   money, he paid back what he owed her.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When he had finished speaking, someone in that gathering sighed deeply and
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “If only I had been assigned such a judge! Indeed, I would not have fallen under
  </p>
  <p>
   the ruling of a most unfair judge in my airtight case. I had a quarrel and a dispute
  </p>
  <p>
   regarding a loan with a certain Laurens. The praetor assigned a certain judge Cratinus
  </p>
  <p>
   to my case, a wicked and capricious man, who ordered that, if it was evident that
  </p>
  <p>
   Laurens had received the money I loaned him and had not given it back, he would
  </p>
  <p>
   convict him. I demonstrated clearly, with witnesses, that I had loaned him the money
  </p>
  <p>
   and I showed the judge his signature. The judge said that the matter had been decided
  </p>
  <p>
   and that it was clearer than the noonday sun. He earnestly begged me, however, to
  </p>
  <p>
   assert that the court was biased. I responded: ‘What are you saying? I should criticize a
  </p>
  <p>
   judge, who appears to be on my side, for treating me unfairly? By god, I will not do that.’
  </p>
  <p>
   But he said: ‘That is what I am asking. But you do as you please.’ I had no cause for
  </p>
  <p>
   208 Senatorial priesthood reserved for patricians.
  </p>
  <p>
   468
  </p>
  <p>
   fear or worry, so why was I hesitating? The matter was simple, and everything was in
  </p>
  <p>
   my favor: justice, equity, and the will of the judge. All of a sudden it was announced that
  </p>
  <p>
   the judge had ruled that Laurens didn’t owe me anything. I rushed in and asked the
  </p>
  <p>
   judge why he had unjustly ruled against me when he had confirmed so many times that
  </p>
  <p>
   I was the stronger party in the case. Listen to the impudence of that man: ‘You deserved
  </p>
  <p>
   it. How many times did I order you to swear that I was biased against you? You have
  </p>
  <p>
   another think coming if you think that I would risk my flourishing enterprise in order to
  </p>
  <p>
   advance your failing ones.’ Afterward I found out, from those in the know, that the judge
  </p>
  <p>
   had unfairly burdened me with that injustice in order to oblige a very powerful man who
  </p>
  <p>
   strongly recommended my adversary’s case to him.”
  </p>
  <p>
   He became very angry at the judge and was made even more furious with the
  </p>
  <p>
   unexpected arrival of a certain man, who they were saying had recently published some
  </p>
  <p>
   sort of book about famous writers of his age.209 The man said to him: “Were you not
  </p>
  <p>
   ashamed to add the name of Janus the mattress maker to that company of illustrious
  </p>
  <p>
   men?210 Did you have no scruples when you placed the common ditties of some idiot or
  </p>
  <p>
   other, which are sung in taverns, gutters, and soup kitchens, or written on fans,211
  </p>
  <p>
   209 Leo Allatius, or Leone Allacci (c. 1586-1669), was a Greek scholar originally from Chios who went to
  </p>
  <p>
   Rome to study theology, Latin, and Greek; he was also trained in medicine. He was appointed custodian
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Vatican Library by Pope Alexander VII in 1661 and remained in that post until his death. The work
  </p>
  <p>
   Rossi refers to here is his Apes urbanae, sive, De viris illustribus qui ab anno 1630 per totum 1632
  </p>
  <p>
   Romae adfuerunt ac typis aliquid evulgarunt. See also Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 20.
  </p>
  <p>
   210 The Latin is culcitrarum concinnator (lit. “maker of mattresses”). This is a reference to Allacci’s
  </p>
  <p>
   inclusion of Giovanni Bricci among the illustrious men featured in his Apes urbane. Bricci was a painter
  </p>
  <p>
   (who possibly studied under Giuseppe Cesari, il Cavaliere d’Arpino), musician, and poet who impressed
  </p>
  <p>
   his contemporaries with his talents. Bricci was the son of Giovanni Battista Bricci, a mattress maker and
  </p>
  <p>
   scrap merchant who relocated from Genova to Rome in 1560 (Gerboni 1899: 131; De Gregori 1942: 271-
  </p>
  <p>
   2; Giachino 2002: 198; DBI).
  </p>
  <p>
   211 This is likely a reference to the fashion of carrying fans printed with the emblems of the Pope or kings
  </p>
  <p>
   along with laudatory poetry of each. These fans were a popular women’s accessory in the sixteenth and
  </p>
  <p>
   469
  </p>
  <p>
   alongside so many outstanding works of excellent men? Perhaps he seemed worthy of
  </p>
  <p>
   being included in the ranks of learned men because he made you a mattress for free.
  </p>
  <p>
   Go and strike my name from your list of learned men! I will search high and low for
  </p>
  <p>
   every exemplar of the works I’ve published, and I will throw them all in the fire to be
  </p>
  <p>
   destroyed. It’s better to endure a reputation as an uneducated and illiterate man than to
  </p>
  <p>
   be recorded among the learned along with Janus and those of his ilk.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While he was speaking we heard a loud noise outside that included the sound of
  </p>
  <p>
   weapons. We ran out and saw two men, their swords drawn, attacking another man and
  </p>
  <p>
   protesting that he had hit them. That man was protecting himself with a lance which he
  </p>
  <p>
   had taken from a nearby tavern. While he was fighting, two silver plates that were
  </p>
  <p>
   wrapped in a napkin and tied to his waist became untied and fell to the ground. By
  </p>
  <p>
   chance, it happened that some unknown archer had arrived there and had been spurred
  </p>
  <p>
   by the voices of the boys, who were giving the other man trouble, to use his arrows to
  </p>
  <p>
   put a stop to their reckless behavior. Leaning down as if he were intending to bend his
  </p>
  <p>
   bow, the man stealthily gathered the plates off the ground while everyone was watching
  </p>
  <p>
   the fight, and, gripping them, extracted himself from the crowd. He has not been seen
  </p>
  <p>
   anywhere since.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once the fight had broken up, we decided to head to the port with Gallonius so
  </p>
  <p>
   the captain would not have to go looking for us if the wind had died down. We went
  </p>
  <p>
   there, but we found that the sea was not yet sufficiently seasonable for setting sail. For
  </p>
  <p>
   that reason, on Gallonius’s urging, we climbed up to the nearest Temple of Ceres,
  </p>
  <p>
   seventeenth centuries (Welch 2005: 12). Rossi is employing this image to signify literary trivia or
  </p>
  <p>
   novelties.
  </p>
  <p>
   470
  </p>
  <p>
   where people were exorcising a young woman who they were saying was insane. She
  </p>
  <p>
   was lying on the ground twisting every which way, and then she let out a wail, frothed at
  </p>
  <p>
   the mouth, and performed many similar acts of madness. The doctor who was placed in
  </p>
  <p>
   charge of her treatment said that she was possessed and being controlled by seven
  </p>
  <p>
   legions of spirits. He was attempting to drive the spirits out of her possessed body with
  </p>
  <p>
   certain specific incantations and drive them back to Orcus. The spirits struggled against
  </p>
  <p>
   him, fought back, and resisted. Finally, unequal in strength (as it were) to those
  </p>
  <p>
   incantations, they conceded defeat. But the spirits turned back around and asked for an
  </p>
  <p>
   extra day to leave. The doctor denied them, scared them with threats, and stood firm on
  </p>
  <p>
   this one point: that they had to leave. Finally, the spirits burst forth and flew out of the
  </p>
  <p>
   young woman’s mouth causing her to vomit as they exited and to spew forth not black
  </p>
  <p>
   or yellow bile, or anything like that, but needles, spoons, string, hair, nail clippings,
  </p>
  <p>
   tacks, and—what is amazing to recount—an iron nail as thick as your thumb and the
  </p>
  <p>
   length of your palm. The doctor carefully collected all of these items and positioned
  </p>
  <p>
   them high up so people would be able to see them. He said that the items had been
  </p>
  <p>
   placed inside a honey apple, by the handiwork of a witch, and given to the woman to
  </p>
  <p>
   devour; and that in the end, after being cast out when she vomited, she was left carrying
  </p>
  <p>
   only a single legion of spirits inside her. He said that the remaining legion of spirits had
  </p>
  <p>
   pitched their camp inside the woman’s stomach with other equally monstrous items, but
  </p>
  <p>
   that it would soon come to pass that they, too, would follow in the footsteps of their
  </p>
  <p>
   fellow spirits, and that she would spew forth whatever monsters were inside her
  </p>
  <p>
   stomach.
  </p>
  <p>
   471
  </p>
  <p>
   We were dumbstruck by the strangeness of this occurrence. We could not
  </p>
  <p>
   properly grasp how a single honey apple could hold so many items or how a sensible
  </p>
  <p>
   and knowledgeable woman could chew up and swallow them, and then throw them
  </p>
  <p>
   back up a year after she had swallowed them whole. Indeed, how did the sharp end of
  </p>
  <p>
   those needles and tacks not damage her throat and stomach? Did she ingest that fist-
  </p>
  <p>
   sized nail into her stomach broken up into tiny bits and chewed up with her teeth, or did
  </p>
  <p>
   she devour it whole? If it was broken up, how were her teeth strong enough to crush
  </p>
  <p>
   iron? If it was whole, how did she not choke on it? But one man who had been present
  </p>
  <p>
   at the scene solved this difficulty for us. He said: “How wittily that trickster thinks he is
  </p>
  <p>
   pulling one over on us! Does that wicked man think we are asses, stupid people, or
  </p>
  <p>
   wooden logs instead of men? As if it were not obvious where those monstrous items
  </p>
  <p>
   were pouring forth from! If you had kept your eyes on her hands, you would not have
  </p>
  <p>
   been deceived. Indeed, if you don’t pay close attention, those tricksters use sleight of
  </p>
  <p>
   hand that escapes your sight.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I said: “Do you believe that no women have ever been possessed, fanatic,
  </p>
  <p>
   or frenzied?” “If only the gods would make them not so!” he said. “But very few of them
  </p>
  <p>
   are seized with this affliction. These days, when a woman’s hatred for her husband sets
  </p>
  <p>
   in and her desire for another takes hold (and when there is no possibility of her gaining
  </p>
  <p>
   possession of him), she orders herself to be carried around as if she were insane. In the
  </p>
  <p>
   case of more simple women, if their foot or head is hurting, if their leg, thigh, or arm
  </p>
  <p>
   becomes swollen, if black bile has induced dark thoughts in them, these scheming men,
  </p>
  <p>
   who support themselves with these deceits—or use them to satisfy their lust—
  </p>
  <p>
   encourage such fear of demons and spirits in these women, and they take money to
  </p>
  <p>
   472
  </p>
  <p>
   invoke Hercules or placate Ceres or to buy herbs and other things for making fumigants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other, more libidinous men seize on similar opportunities to forge a path to intimacy
  </p>
  <p>
   with women. Pretending to administer medical treatments, they grope the maidens and
  </p>
  <p>
   noblewomen of the house and, if fortune or good luck favors their attempts, they strip
  </p>
  <p>
   them of their virginity as well. In this way, they procure challenging and expensive love
  </p>
  <p>
   affairs for themselves at no cost and without any trouble or expense.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Another man said: “The man who chose this story for us to hear is telling the
  </p>
  <p>
   truth. I will narrate what I saw, with my very own eyes, so the shamelessness of these
  </p>
  <p>
   men will be better known to you. During the period when I was serving as the valet of
  </p>
  <p>
   King Alectrius,212 the great and most renowned king of those vast regions, a few
  </p>
  <p>
   scoundrels came to our city with a woman who (they were boasting) was possessed by
  </p>
  <p>
   many thousands of spirits. They climbed up onto a platform that had been erected in the
  </p>
  <p>
   forum, right below the windows of the royal place. At that moment, the woman began to
  </p>
  <p>
   shout, wail, move her body back and forth, and throw herself into their arms. The
  </p>
  <p>
   scoundrels held her, called upon Hercules, Ceres, Apollo, and Jove, praying for the
  </p>
  <p>
   gods to be propitious. The spirits, despite the fear being instilled in them of so many
  </p>
  <p>
   divinities, were not dislodged even the slightest bit, but they barricaded themselves
  </p>
  <p>
   inside her possessed body with a fortification, as if they were inside a great citadel. The
  </p>
  <p>
   woman, as if the spirits were responding through her very own mouth, spoke in various
  </p>
  <p>
   languages and answered questions. Most importantly, the ghosts insisted that they
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn’t withdraw from the woman farther than even a finger’s breadth until she had
  </p>
  <p>
   212 This pseudonym for the King of France derives from the Greek word ἀλεκτρυών meaning rooster, or
  </p>
  <p>
   gallus in Latin (see also Eud. 1998, Lib. VII n. 21). The Gallic rooster (coq gaulois) is the unofficial symbol
  </p>
  <p>
   of France.

  <p>
   473
  </p>
  <p>
   visited the Temple of Diana Daphnitae;213 that Diana was the only one who could order
  </p>
  <p>
   them to leave; and that, even if Jupiter himself were to come and bring with him twelve
  </p>
  <p>
   more gods than there actually are in heaven, he would depart a frustrated
  </p>
  <p>
   laughingstock. The Temple of Diana Daphnitae was located a thousand miles away.
  </p>
  <p>
   The scoundrels then moved the populace to compassion with their skilled speechifying
  </p>
  <p>
   by speaking of the woman’s poverty and of how she didn’t even have the few pennies
  </p>
  <p>
   necessary to dine that day, let alone to take up such a long pilgrimage at her own
  </p>
  <p>
   expense. They then appealed to the people’s aid. They begged and pleaded with them
  </p>
  <p>
   to help the poor woman, ready her purse, and equip her with provisions for her voyage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greatly moved, the people showed compassion, rushed to help, and brought her
  </p>
  <p>
   donations. The scoundrels thanked the people, praised their piety, and promised to
  </p>
  <p>
   bring back many delightful things the next day and on following days, thanks to that mad
  </p>
  <p>
   woman, and adding that the people should come watch the show bearing their usual
  </p>
  <p>
   donations.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The king, who was watching everything from his window (I was standing next to
  </p>
  <p>
   him), assigned a man the task of going, inquiring, and investigating where these men
  </p>
  <p>
   interacting with his people were from, who they were, and what their social standing and
  </p>
  <p>
   profession was. The man obeyed, ran out, got close to the men, secretly followed them,
  </p>
  <p>
   and saw them turn into a room at an inn. In brief, the man entered the inn, noted the
  </p>
  <p>
   room where the men were staying, and went into another room adjacent to theirs. While

  </p>
  <p>
   della Santa Casa in Loreto or to Santa Maria di Loreto in Rome. Though Rossi tends to refer to people,
  </p>
  <p>
   places, and things that are local to him and his circle, the mention of the long distance to the temple could
  </p>
  <p>
   indicate that he is speaking of the basilica in Loreto, which is about 150 miles from Rome.
  </p>
  <p>
   474
  </p>
  <p>
   the scoundrels were out he took a drill and opened up a fairly wide hole in the wall,
  </p>
  <p>
   which was made of panels covered with plaster, and from there he began hunting birds
  </p>
  <p>
   with his eyes and snaring them with his ears. The scoundrels returned, ordered dinner,
  </p>
  <p>
   and (as was the custom of those people) gave themselves over to lightheartedness and
  </p>
  <p>
   sport. They sang, danced, grabbed the woman around her waist, laid her down on the
  </p>
  <p>
   ground, took her in their arms, and had their way with her. After this, dinner arrived and
  </p>
  <p>
   was placed on the table. They sat down, ate, drank, and did not hold back in any joy,
  </p>
  <p>
   hilarity, or sport. After they had had enough of wine and feasting, they communicated to
  </p>
  <p>
   the woman the things they wanted her to learn by heart, which they were going to pawn
  </p>
  <p>
   off on the people the following day, and although
  </p>
  <p>
   if a woman has to do something bad and malicious, her memory for that is
  </p>
  <p>
   immortal and perpetual,214
  </p>
  <p>
   nevertheless, because they feared that their fraud would be uncovered if she at all
  </p>
  <p>
   hesitated, she was forced to go over many times what they dictated to her. They then
  </p>
  <p>
   began thinking about sleep. There were two little beds placed next to each other, which
  </p>
  <p>
   they had taken pains to join together to create a single bed. They all lay down on the
  </p>
  <p>
   bed at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
   “After they had done this, the spy who had been sent by the king reckoned that
  </p>
  <p>
   the matter was clear enough, wrapped up his investigation, and left to report everything
  </p>
  <p>
   he had seen to the king. The king was glad that he had not been misled in his hunch.
  </p>
  <p>
   He therefore ordered all of them to be locked up in jail. After a formal complaint had
  </p>
  <p>
   been lodged, everything the spy had seen was brought out in their own words and

  <p>
   475
  </p>
  <p>
   entered into the official record. Because they had been caught red-handed, they did not
  </p>
  <p>
   dare deny it. Learn the method of punishment and, at the same time, admire the king’s
  </p>
  <p>
   wisdom. He ordered them to publicly sing a palinode215 in the forum from the same
  </p>
  <p>
   platform where they had come to play their tricks on the people, like crows gouging out
  </p>
  <p>
   the eyes of other crows. If they refused, they would immediately be sent to the cross. To
  </p>
  <p>
   avoid having stones thrown at them, the king placed armed men all around to fend off
  </p>
  <p>
   the force and attacks of the people. Fearing the cross, the tricksters did what they were
  </p>
  <p>
   told. The following day they were forced by the king’s command into exile and they
  </p>
  <p>
   retreated beyond the borders of the kingdom.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But why did my story go farther afield and not contain itself within the boundaries
  </p>
  <p>
   of our city? Don’t we also have greedy flamens of the immortal gods here among us,
  </p>
  <p>
   who often bring some crazed person (either genuinely mad or pretending to be) into
  </p>
  <p>
   their temples in order to draw people in for profit? The Temple of Mercury, located here
  </p>
  <p>
   in our city, is the largest and most sumptuous of all the temples, and it once had a
  </p>
  <p>
   certain Alexis as its sexton who was a filthy and shameful man. The wickedest of all
  </p>
  <p>
   exaggerators, he was known for his loathsome love of boys and often showed himself
  </p>
  <p>
   guilty of theft. Moreover, he always had some dedicated house upon which every pimp
  </p>
  <p>
   and gambler, rounded up from all directions, would descend and where everyone’s
  </p>
  <p>
   passions gravitated. No boy could set foot in that house and leave with his purity intact.
  </p>
  <p>
   No chaste person who entered there could leave again without being tarnished by some
  </p>
  <p>
   disgraceful act. With these enticements, it came about that the sacristan became
  </p>
  <p>
   everybody’s favorite person. He was finally poisoned, in secret, by the head lictor
  </p>
  <p>
   215 A poem in which the poet retracts a view or sentiment expressed in a former one.
  </p>
  <p>
   476
  </p>
  <p>
   because he had brought a false charge against someone. After the head lictor had
  </p>
  <p>
   made the praetor and the Rex Sacrorum aware of this (both of whom agreed that the
  </p>
  <p>
   charge was false), they considered the sacristan to be either spiteful because he had
  </p>
  <p>
   brought false accusations, or negligent because he had presented accusations that
  </p>
  <p>
   were not well investigated or scrutinized. Nevertheless, the head lictor admitted publicly,
  </p>
  <p>
   before a large audience, that he had caused harm with the man’s untimely death, since
  </p>
  <p>
   the office of the praetors had never had a better or keener spy than he.
  </p>
  <p>
   “A most ancient shrine to Ceres was located in that temple, enclosed within iron

  <p>
   bars and imbued with the greatest and most ancient holiness. The shrine contained a
  </p>
  <p>
   stone upon which (it was said) Ceres herself had sat down after being overcome with
  </p>
  <p>
   exhaustion while searching for Proserpina.216 They said that this stone had great power
  </p>
  <p>
   for expiating madness. The noble painter Uranius had undertaken, at that time, to paint
  </p>
  <p>
   a certain picture in which he depicted the goddess Diana’s virgins bathing her, covered
  </p>
  <p>
   in sweat and dust from hunting, in a sacred river. One day he heard a voice near him
  </p>
  <p>
   crying out from morning to evening. After the sacred rites were finished and with night
  </p>
  <p>
   coming on, the voice did not lose any of its strength but made its force felt even
  </p>
  <p>
   stronger. Uranius realized that the voice was coming from the shrine. He went over to
  </p>
  <p>
   the shrine and asked the man who was enclosed there why he was wailing. The man
  </p>
  <p>
   replied: ‘Alexis hired me for fifteen obols today to pretend I was possessed and to fill the
  </p>
  <p>
   temple with my cries and wails. I have been yelling myself hoarse but nobody has
  </p>
  <p>
   showed up to pay me. What is even more bothersome, I am wracked with a need to
  </p>
  <p>
   216 Proserpina (or Persephone) was abducted by Pluto and taken to his kingdom in the Underworld
  </p>
  <p>
   leaving her mother Ceres (or Demeter) to search for her frantically.
  </p>
  <p>
   477
  </p>
  <p>
   defecate. If he does not come and unlock these bars, I will surely empty my bowels right
  </p>
  <p>
   here.’ Then Uranius responded: ‘That’s exactly what you must do. Come on now, empty
  </p>
  <p>
   your bowels and, when he comes back and cheats you out of your agreed-upon wages,
  </p>
  <p>
   throw whatever comes out in his face.’” He finished speaking and fell silent. Paulus
  </p>
  <p>
   Aemilius said: “Who are those people who say that tricksters and schemers are only
  </p>
  <p>
   found in Rome? From what I hear, people live according to the same morals
  </p>
  <p>
   everywhere.”
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, a young man had arrived from the ship’s captain and
  </p>
  <p>
   announced that the waves had calmed down and that the captain had decided to set
  </p>
  <p>
   sail and to travel, with all possible speed, to the next island over; and so we should
  </p>
  <p>
   come quickly. We listened to the instruction, started running, and encountered the ship’s
  </p>
  <p>
   captain fighting with a surgeon, who was very much pleading with him to take him on
  </p>
  <p>
   board the ship with the other passengers. The captain was refusing because the ship
  </p>
  <p>
   was full and could not accommodate anyone else. Gallonius asked the surgeon why he
  </p>
  <p>
   had been seized by this great desire to set sail, since he had always avoided the sea.
  </p>
  <p>
   The surgeon answered that it was his father’s cruelty that was making him move from
  </p>
  <p>
   his native land into exile, because he had thrown him out of the house. “Yesterday, as I
  </p>
  <p>
   think you know, those of us who heal wounds with our hands took in the body of a
  </p>
  <p>
   servant who had been sent to the cross by the triumvirs on account of a capital crime.
  </p>
  <p>
   We did this so we could cut him open for the benefit of finding cures for the living, and to
  </p>
  <p>
   obtain a thorough knowledge of the position, color, shape, and size of his organs. I
  </p>
  <p>
   plucked the liver from the remains of his body and brought it home so I could carefully
  </p>
  <p>
   examine every part of it—the fibers and the little membranes that bind it to the
  </p>
  <p>
   478
  </p>
  <p>
   enclosure that separates the abdomen from the chest wall—and I placed the liver over a
  </p>
  <p>
   rack that hangs on the wall in my room. Then I went out because I had some business
  </p>
  <p>
   in the forum.
  </p>
  <p>
   “A little while later, when lunchtime had already passed, I went home, entered my
  </p>
  <p>
   room, looked around, and could not find the liver anywhere. I asked our maidservant
  </p>
  <p>
   what had happened to it and why she had dared to touch it while I was out. A great
  </p>
  <p>
   argument broke out between us over this. My father, roused by the noise, came over
  </p>
  <p>
   and said: ‘What is the meaning of all this racket? Why are the two of you fighting?’ I
  </p>
  <p>
   replied: ‘This villain here stole a liver from me that I had brought home to study—and I
  </p>
  <p>
   can’t find out what happened to it.’ Then my father said: ‘Why do you need to be making
  </p>
  <p>
   all this noise? Even if she did take it, what offense has the woman caused? Just to let
  </p>
  <p>
   you know, a little while ago we cooked it up and devoured it for lunch. I have never
  </p>
  <p>
   eaten a dish anywhere that my taste buds enjoyed more. Try it, and you too will say the
  </p>
  <p>
   same thing. I saved some for you in the kitchen cupboard.’ Almost beside myself with
  </p>
  <p>
   anger (it was not that easy to find another liver), I said: ‘That was a fine crime you
  </p>
  <p>
   committed. You ate the liver of a crucified man!’ That is not what my father wanted to
  </p>
  <p>
   hear and he became enraged shouting: ‘You are the worst! You made a cannibal out of
  </p>
  <p>
   me today! Why didn’t you say anything before? Why did you store it out in the open?
  </p>
  <p>
   Get out of here and go to hell—and make sure you don’t show your face around here
  </p>
  <p>
   again! If I catch sight of you around these parts after tonight, I will scatter you about in
  </p>
  <p>
   little pieces. I will rip out your liver with my teeth and see to it that I have a dinner that
  </p>
  <p>
   matches my lunch!’ Fearing the sight of my father, I am going search of other provinces
  </p>
  <p>
   479
  </p>
  <p>
   and, although I do not have a lot of traveling money, I nevertheless hope to support
  </p>
  <p>
   myself with my profession.”
  </p>
  <p>
   We listened to the young man’s account with horror and disgust, but we laughed
  </p>
  <p>
   anyway at the man who had stuffed himself with human flesh. We told the young man to
  </p>
  <p>
   cheer up, and we begged the ship’s captain to let him aboard. The ship’s captain said
  </p>
  <p>
   that it was not going to be possible if that disagreeable old man was also coming, who
  </p>
  <p>
   was going to delay everyone on account of his arrogance. He was about to say more
  </p>
  <p>
   regarding that man’s haughtiness and pride, but Plusius, who was reading some poem
  </p>
  <p>
   or other to another man on the pier of the port, attracted our attention. He seemed to
  </p>
  <p>
   applaud the poem with his look and expression. When Plusius saw us he called out and
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “Listen to this charming poem that the young Aridus Virgilius217 sent along. He is
  </p>
  <p>
   the son of Brother Ursatus,218 the great priest and dynast whom we recently mourned
  </p>
  <p>
   upon his death”:
  </p>
  <p>
   O Virgil—the rising new hope of the people, the delight and honor of the
  </p>
  <p>
   house of Ursatus—appearing under good auspices, you arrive, a shining
  </p>
  <p>
   star of heaven, bringing lights abounding with the gleaming rays of virtue!
  </p>
  <p>
   Since nature, according to your merits, entrusted you with a talent that
  </p>
  <p>
   was neither small nor confined within the limits of a single course of study,
  </p>
  <p>
   like water being restrained within a small channel, but was instead strong
  </p>
  <p>
   and able to break through barriers and extend through the various liberal
  </p>
  <p>
   arts like a mighty river—made powerful with rainfall or by its own nature—
  </p>
  <p>
   that overflows its banks and, meandering, traverses vast estates. Learned
  </p>
  <p>
   in a hundred liberal arts, you, still a boy, hasten with great strides to aim
  </p>
  <p>
   for the heights of genuine glory. Is there anyone who does not imbibe, with
  </p>
  <p>
   avid ears, the speeches you pour forth from your fertile mind, which are
  </p>
  <p>
   magnificent and glowing with rosy nectar, whether you are joining words in
  </p>
  <p>
   217 Virgilio Orsini (1615-1676) was from the ducal family of Bracciano. Rossi originally published this
  </p>
  <p>
   poem about the real Virgilio Orsini in 1627 when Orsini was twelve years old. Orsini’s youthful talent is
  </p>
  <p>
   reflected in the description of him as “pene puer” (almost a boy). He was twenty-two years old when
  </p>
  <p>
   Eudemia was first published in 1637 and would become a cardinal four years later, in 1641, at the age of
  </p>
  <p>
   twenty-six.

  <p>
   480
  </p>
  <p>
   the poetic meter or consenting to proceed in prose? Whom does your
  </p>
  <p>
   honesty—ornamented with outstanding morals—and your pure integrity
  </p>
  <p>
   not draw to itself and bind in pleasing fetters. Who does not feel wondrous
  </p>
  <p>
   joy at those battles where you, at play, attack wild beats, whether you are
  </p>
  <p>
   hunting a boar in the cold outdoors or slaying a deer with a powerful blow?
  </p>
  <p>
   It is no wonder that you have been so strong from the time you were very
  </p>
  <p>
   small. For in your home your father was illustrious, and so was your
  </p>
  <p>
   grandfather219 who, playing sweetly on his Thracian harp, was able to halt
  </p>
  <p>
   rivers and draw oak trees down from high mountains. These men
  </p>
  <p>
   possessed the wisdom of powerful Laelius and the attractive strength of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Scipios.220 But while you are forming and preparing yourself as a boy,
  </p>
  <p>
   attentive to your ancestral customs, you demonstrate how—since it is right
  </p>
  <p>
   for you to live your life of your own accord and holding fast to your
  </p>
  <p>
   purpose—you resist with firm intention the carnal desires that lead wanton
  </p>
  <p>
   men toward forbidden sin. In much the same way as the straight pine tree
  </p>
  <p>
   strikes the air as it grows, or the tall ash with its tender bark, with its
  </p>
  <p>
   leaves glowing far and wide, will not fear rain showers or raging North
  </p>
  <p>
   winds and will not bow its head before the clouds.
  </p>
  <p>
   The refinement and style of the poem pleased me exceedingly. I said: “Plusius, I would
  </p>
  <p>
   gladly take it with me if I had time to copy it out, but we have to depart soon and are
  </p>
  <p>
   pressed by lack of time.” Plusius said kindly: “Take this one. I can produce six hundred
  </p>
  <p>
   copies where I transcribed that one from.” I accepted it and thanked him.
  </p>
  <p>
   At that very same moment Plusius pointed out a philosopher from the religious
  </p>
  <p>
   community that is bound by oath to the cult of Minerva.221 The most important aspect of
  </p>
  <p>
   their vow is that they abstain from women and from any form of sexual intercourse.
  </p>
  <p>
   Every year their leaders, on behalf of the rest, vote to select a single person whose
  </p>
  <p>
   authority they stand at the ready to obey on command. They all wear similar clothing;
  </p>
  <p>
   219 Virginio Orsini, second Duke of Bracciano (1572-1615).
  </p>
  <p>
   220 Gaius Laelius (c.235-c.160 BCE) served under P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus the elder in Spain (209-
  </p>
  <p>
   206 BCE) and in Africa (205-202 BCE), becoming his close friend and protégé. The Scipios are P.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cornelius Scipio Africanus the elder (236-183 BCE), who conquered the Carthaginians in the Second
  </p>
  <p>
   Punic War, and P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus the younger (185-129 BCE), who conquered the
  </p>
  <p>
   same peoples in the Third Punic War.
  </p>
  <p>
   221 Jesuits (although the manuscript keys referenced in Appendix A identify them as Dominicans).
  </p>
  <p>
   481
  </p>
  <p>
   they eat their meals together; they never walk alone but always in pairs, in threes, or in
  </p>
  <p>
   fours; they reject all pleasures; and they embrace all virtues, especially, of course,
  </p>
  <p>
   chastity, which Minerva prides herself in. Their training is thought to have been devised
  </p>
  <p>
   and advanced by Xenocrates,222 a disciple of Plato, so on account of this belief in their
  </p>
  <p>
   virtue, and thanks to the regard in which they are held, everyone yields to them, makes
  </p>
  <p>
   way for them, and their reputation is considered to be that of living gods. They are
  </p>
  <p>
   permitted to enter into the homes of noblemen, without any suspicion of wrongdoing, to
  </p>
  <p>
   penetrate their most intimate chambers, to visit their wives while the husbands are out,
  </p>
  <p>
   to talk to them, console them, and to support them with their counsel, aid, and influence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plusius pointed one of them out to us and said: “That is the one who is held in
  </p>
  <p>
   such contempt these days.” We asked why this was, and he responded: “He is an
  </p>
  <p>
   associate of that philosopher, the one who used to go every day to visit Pamphila, wife
  </p>
  <p>
   of the nobleman Lysimachus; and after getting rid of any eyewitnesses, he used to
  </p>
  <p>
   spend many hours with her alone in her room. This associate would sit without food in a
  </p>
  <p>
   second room with a chambermaid, a charming girl, and see to it that no one else
  </p>
  <p>
   entered. One day he became tired of waiting and said to the girl: ‘Please tell me, what
  </p>
  <p>
   business are those two conducting in the bedroom?’ The girl, laughing and joyful, said:
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘Do you think they are encouraging each other’s chastity? Are you chewing on
  </p>
  <p>
   wormwood or so asleep that you can’t see the obvious? They are giving in to their
  </p>
  <p>
   desires and, in my opinion, they are doing the right thing. We, on the other hand, are
  </p>
  <p>
   idling, abstaining, and acting as their lookouts. Why don’t we also spend the day happily
  </p>
  <p>
   222 Xenocrates of Chalcedon (c. 396/5-314/3 BCE) was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and leader
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Plato’s Academy from 339 to 314 BCE).
  </p>
  <p>
   482
  </p>
  <p>
   after their example?’ There was no need for many words to persuade the man, aroused
  </p>
  <p>
   to wickedness by the heat of his age, the allurement of the opportunity, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   woman’s words. He remembered the profession of faith and the vow that bound him to
  </p>
  <p>
   Minerva but, believing that the virgin had a better idea, he said: ‘Let others maintain
  </p>
  <p>
   their faith in their promise to Minerva. Far be it from me to waste such a good
  </p>
  <p>
   opportunity. Let me sail where the wind is blowing!’ And he sank at once into the
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden’s bosom.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It didn’t only happen that day, but every day thereafter, as often as the
  </p>
  <p>
   noblewoman’s companion was locked in her room performing his duties. Finally,
  </p>
  <p>
   however, when some time had passed the maiden’s body began to swell, such that the
  </p>
  <p>
   nobleman Lysimachus demanded to know, in the presence of his wife, what the cause
  </p>
  <p>
   of the swelling was. Since the matter was clear and maiden could not lie, Lysimachus
  </p>
  <p>
   sought to identify the person responsible for this shameful deed. The wife, whose heart
  </p>
  <p>
   was full of tricks and deceit, and who knew that the maiden’s shame was connected to
  </p>
  <p>
   her own disgrace, pretended to be angry and said: ‘Look at that man’s face! Look how
  </p>
  <p>
   he pretends not to know what he knows and not to have done what he did—as if it is
  </p>
  <p>
   any mystery whose fault this is! You wicked man, you are guilty of this crime. Poor me! I
  </p>
  <p>
   am not able to defend anyone’s chastity from his assault in my own home, whether it be
  </p>
  <p>
   a maidservant’s or a free woman’s! How can I tolerate being married to this man, who
  </p>
  <p>
   keeps mistresses at home but neglects his wife’s interests? Did I enter into this
  </p>
  <p>
   marriage, only to have to witness such things and tolerate such insults?’
  </p>
  <p>
   “Her husband Lysimachus, conscious of the fact that he had committed no sin
  </p>
  <p>
   against the maiden, was angered by his wife’s abuse. In order to prove that he was not
  </p>
  <p>
   483
  </p>
  <p>
   responsible for this crime, he attacked the maiden saying: ‘Tell me who got you
  </p>
  <p>
   pregnant.’ Because the maiden was keeping their secret—so as not to reveal, out of a
  </p>
  <p>
   hateful betrayal, the noblewoman’s indiscretion together with her own shame—the
  </p>
  <p>
   husband became even more incensed saying: ‘Do you think I won’t be able to wring the
  </p>
  <p>
   truth out of you today?’ He pulled out his dagger and brought it up to the maiden’s
  </p>
  <p>
   throat, and he repeatedly threatened to slit it unless she told him who had taken away
  </p>
  <p>
   her virginity earlier. Fearing for her life, the maiden at last revealed that she had been
  </p>
  <p>
   violated by that most chaste man, while he was waiting on his companion who was
  </p>
  <p>
   locked in the room with the noblewoman.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Lysimachus, as if driven by the Furies, ran to the house of the philosophers,
  </p>
  <p>
   summoned their leader, and related the crime that had been committed against the
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden. He demanded that, unless the head philosopher wanted the entire city to be
  </p>
  <p>
   filled with shouting and noise, the filthy man be handed over to him as a criminal, so
  </p>
  <p>
   that, through his punishment and suffering, the husband could alleviate his pain and
  </p>
  <p>
   assuage his mind. The head philosopher deflected the crime away from his protégé
  </p>
  <p>
   saying that the real sinner was the woman, because she was conjuring up such
  </p>
  <p>
   disgrace against the philosopher who was a most holy man. In fact, there was no one in
  </p>
  <p>
   that household who was more honest or chaste than he. Lysimachus insisted that the
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher had done it, and the head philosopher denied it. But when the nobleman
  </p>
  <p>
   raised his voice even more the head philosopher, fearing that the neighbors would
  </p>
  <p>
   come running and that the crime would become public, gently approached the man and
  </p>
  <p>
   asked him to go home. The head philosopher promised to investigate the matter and
  </p>
  <p>
   not to dismiss it without punishment. Persuaded by these words, Lysimachus checked
  </p>
  <p>
   484
  </p>
  <p>
   his anger a bit, and he resolved to wait until the head philosopher had made good on
  </p>
  <p>
   his promise.
  </p>
  <p>
   “In the meantime, the philosopher, accused of having had sexual intercourse,
  </p>
  <p>
   was thrown into jail on the head philosopher’s orders, and he was given a cup
  </p>
  <p>
   containing hemlock diluted with wine. He was given the choice of either drinking it, after
  </p>
  <p>
   which he would lose his life in the space of an hour, or he could consent to being
  </p>
  <p>
   castrated. After deliberating, the philosopher—believing that living under any conditions
  </p>
  <p>
   would be better than not living at all—gladly presented his testicles to be cut off.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sometime later, when his wound had healed, the head philosopher met with
  </p>
  <p>
   Lysimachus and asked whether he had come to believe in the innocence of his protégé.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lysimachus said confidently that there was nothing he was more certain of than that the
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden had been violated by that most wicked man, and that the matter could not be
  </p>
  <p>
   ignored. Then the head philosopher said: ‘I will now get you to understand how
  </p>
  <p>
   mistaken you are.’ He ordered the gelding223 to come take clothes off in front of
  </p>
  <p>
   Lysimachus. In doing so, he exposed his groin with its missing testicles. Then the head
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher, as if moved, said: ‘How do you respond? Does this man, who was
  </p>
  <p>
   castrated a long time ago when he was a boy and whom, on account of the manifest
  </p>
  <p>
   integrity of his life, it was fitting to make a priest of the Great Mother, seem capable of
  </p>
  <p>
   getting a woman pregnant? From now on, when the reputation of a good man is at
  </p>
  <p>
   stake, please control yourself, if you know what’s good for you, and do not constantly fill
  </p>
  <p>
   people’s ears with false rumors about him.’ Lysimachus was so cowed by this deception
  </p>
  <p>
   223 The Latin word is vervex, a castrated sheep or a wether. I chose to use the word for a castrated horse,
  </p>
  <p>
   gelding, as it is a more common and recognizable English word.
  </p>
  <p>
   485
  </p>
  <p>
   that he did not know where he was, and he did not have any ready response. Because
  </p>
  <p>
   of this, fearing both his own judgment (because he had slandered a devotee of Minerva
  </p>
  <p>
   with an odious crime) and his wife’s ire, he resolved to get back into her good graces
  </p>
  <p>
   and not even believe himself.” The cunning means that the head philosopher had
  </p>
  <p>
   employed in order to vindicate the reputation of his household in public opinion so
  </p>
  <p>
   delighted me that nobody’s shrewdness and cleverness has ever persuaded me to
  </p>
  <p>
   greater admiration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallonius said: “If you like, I will show you that sniveling old man who sent
  </p>
  <p>
   vinegar instead of wine.” We looked over and saw a skinny old man hunched over,
  </p>
  <p>
   wrinkled, the color of a weasel, and with blackish hair that was not yet discolored with
  </p>
  <p>
   any gray. He was being asked, from out of a whore’s window, what he wanted from that
  </p>
  <p>
   house. Merlinus said: “Open up, I need to talk to you.” The whore replied: “I don’t have
  </p>
  <p>
   time right now, I am busy with my lover.” But Merlinus continued to shout: “Give me
  </p>
  <p>
   back the money you stole, you hag! I thought you were just shameless, not greedy as
  </p>
  <p>
   well!” Taking no notice of him, the woman went away and left the man arguing in vain.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the old man kept yelling anyway: “Give me back my money, you filthy woman! If you
  </p>
  <p>
   don’t give it back, I will ruin your reputation by berating you right here in front of your
  </p>
  <p>
   house.” Gallonius ran over and asked, in the name of their friendship, what happened
  </p>
  <p>
   and why he was yelling like that. He replied: “I usually come to this wretched woman’s
  </p>
  <p>
   house just for fun after lunch, and I spend my afternoon hours with her in bed. Today
  </p>
  <p>
   while I was lying with her, per my usual routine, she secretly got out of bed, went
  </p>
  <p>
   straight for my trousers, and (with me completely unsuspecting) she disemboweled the
  </p>
  <p>
   wallet that was inside them. Afterward she came back, approached me, and insisted
  </p>
  <p>
   486
  </p>
  <p>
   that I get up and give my place to some lover of hers who was especially profitable for
  </p>
  <p>
   her. I got up, obeyed, did what she wanted, and left. I arrived at Janus Gate to pay off a
  </p>
  <p>
   little bit of the money I owed to a friend from a reckoning of accounts. I put my hand in
  </p>
  <p>
   my wallet and found nothing left—that traitor had sucked all the life out of it.” While
  </p>
  <p>
   Merlinus was sadly lamenting the fate of his wallet, someone came and told us that that
  </p>
  <p>
   peevish old man, whom we had been waiting on to board the ship, had been struck by a
  </p>
  <p>
   sudden fever, was bedridden, and, according to the opinion of the doctors, did not think
  </p>
  <p>
   he would be able to set sail. The ship’s captain gave thanks to the goddess Febris224 for
  </p>
  <p>
   removing that barf bag from his ship, and instead he brought on board that young doctor
  </p>
  <p>
   we had been talking about. After embracing Gallonius once, again, and a third time, we
  </p>
  <p>
   both said goodbye to him, and we entrusted our lives to Neptune.
  </p>
  <p>
   Book Eight
  </p>
  <p>
   Everyone in our entire group aboard the ship was approaching and standing
  </p>
  <p>
   around this one man and asking him why Fortune had suddenly reduced a certain
  </p>
  <p>
   soldier (whose name I don’t remember) to dire straits from a condition of greatest
  </p>
  <p>
   wealth. He was from some order or other of voluntary soldiers—an order he had
  </p>
  <p>
   founded himself. There were many of these sorts of military orders in these parts, who
  </p>
  <p>
   wear a Greek Y (upsilon) sewn onto their cloaks with silk thread, either white or red, and
  </p>
  <p>
   either simple or interlaid with silver and gold, as the rule of each order dictates. They
  </p>
  <p>
   were asking what role this once lucky soldier played in his own reversal of fortune. The
  </p>
  <p>
   man told us that Fortune had never looked out for the soldier, and had never enriched
  </p>
  <p>
   him with estates and farms whose profits could support such great, and so many,
  </p>
  <p>
   224 The patron goddess of fevers, invoked by the Romans to protect them from illness.
  </p>
  <p>
   487
  </p>
  <p>
   expenses. But it is amazing how skilled in vice he was that, with his clever stratagems
  </p>
  <p>
   and tricks, he accrued to himself such a quantity of gold that it covered his unbridled
  </p>
  <p>
   expenses for a long time.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the soldier had first set foot on the island, he was poor, tattered, reliant on
  </p>
  <p>
   others, and was surviving on bread that he had begged off of the kinds of people who
  </p>
  <p>
   support the poor with leftovers from their own table. Then, all of a sudden, he obtained
  </p>
  <p>
   mountains of gold and went from being like Irus to being like Croesus or Attalus.225 He
  </p>
  <p>
   decorated his incredibly sumptuous villa, which he rented for a great sum, with rugs
  </p>
  <p>
   worthy of Attalus; he constructed a storeroom, a granary, and a wine cellar; he
  </p>
  <p>
   assembled a household staff of reputable people; he dressed his many servants in
  </p>
  <p>
   colorful clothing; he supplied his dining room, on a daily basis, in an impressive and
  </p>
  <p>
   splendid manner; he only set the table with silver dishes; and he put on meals worthy of
  </p>
  <p>
   the festival of Ceres with leftovers that stuffed many a glutton. What more can I say? He
  </p>
  <p>
   measured his gold coins by the peck and the triple peck, and you would have thought
  </p>
  <p>
   he made daily sacrifices to Hercules.
  </p>
  <p>
   The strangeness of his situation attracted everyone’s attention. Word spread
  </p>
  <p>
   among the people that he was producing gold at his house. This rumor reached the
  </p>
  <p>
   ears of the Rex Sacrorum, who, by virtue of his civil and military authority, gave the
  </p>
  <p>
   quaestor the task of inquiring, investigating, and examining whether those gold coins,
  </p>
  <p>
   with which the man abounded, were real or fake. The quaestor did not delay, but he
  </p>
  <p>
   approached the man, along with his lictors, and ordered him to hand over his gold,
  </p>
  <p>
   225 Irus is the pejorative nickname for the beggar Arnaeus in Homer’s Odyssey because he ran errands
  </p>
  <p>
   for everyone (from the masculine form of Iris, messenger to the gods). The Lydian king Croesus and
  </p>
  <p>
   Attalus I of Pergamon were both famous for their great wealth.
  </p>
  <p>
   488
  </p>
  <p>
   which the man promptly did. The quaestor picked up the coins, inspected them once,
  </p>
  <p>
   again, and many times over, and did not find anything amiss. The soldier, to clear up
  </p>
  <p>
   the matter and show solid evidence, cut quite a few of the coins with shears—many
  </p>
  <p>
   times and each time in half—so it would be plainly evident if, by chance, something
  </p>
  <p>
   fraudulent were concealed inside them; then, as if annoyed, he threw the coins on the
  </p>
  <p>
   ground and made the lictors pick them up. The quaestor left believing that the soldier
  </p>
  <p>
   was endowed with much wealth and was free from any suspicion of wrongdoing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The quaestor’s judgment resulted in the soldier having such a reputation for
  </p>
  <p>
   wealth that everyone flocked openly to him, as if to Midas, in order to enrich himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whoever was able to entrust his gold to the soldier considered himself lucky because,
  </p>
  <p>
   after a few days, he could say that he had received favorable interest. The soldier
  </p>
  <p>
   bolstered this opinion of himself through his spending and generosity. He practiced this
  </p>
  <p>
   to such an extent that, at certain times of the year, especially at the Aphrodisia Festival
  </p>
  <p>
   held in honor of Venus (under whose banner the soldier marched), he would supply
  </p>
  <p>
   clothing to several unmarried girls, and he would make every effort to have a banquet
  </p>
  <p>
   set up and prepared, to which he invited not only the most eminent men and all his
  </p>
  <p>
   friends, but whoever wished to attend. Through his generosity he convinced people to
  </p>
  <p>
   believe, for absolute certain, that he alone held the method for making gold, which many
  </p>
  <p>
   had attempted but, so far, no one had discovered. And he had nothing to hide, for he
  </p>
  <p>
   often openly told anyone who would listen that, in his hands, they would have as many
  </p>
  <p>
   lumps of gold as they wanted within a few hours and with almost no effort. And they
  </p>
  <p>
   believed him. Although his endless outlay of funds frequently drained whatever
  </p>
  <p>
   resources he had at home—so that in the evening he had not even one cent left over—
  </p>
  <p>
   489
  </p>
  <p>
   the next morning piles of gold coins could be seen on his table. His eloquence, along
  </p>
  <p>
   with a certain natural virtuosity in speaking, won him a great deal of trust in the things
  </p>
  <p>
   he said. Namely, there was a sort of power to his speech that seemed impossible to
  </p>
  <p>
   resist. Moreover, he assumed an attitude that was so haughty and arrogant that he
  </p>
  <p>
   insisted on being considered on par with princes; he held the orators of the greatest
  </p>
  <p>
   kings in little esteem; and he sought alliances with the leading citizens of the city.
  </p>
  <p>
   Persuaded by his reputation (since Jupiter was raining gold down on him from
  </p>
  <p>
   the heavens), these leading citizens came to him of their own accord seeking to marry
  </p>
  <p>
   their daughters to him. Out of all these marriage proposals he liked Via’s daughter the
  </p>
  <p>
   best. She was a very beautiful maiden who was related by blood to more than one line
  </p>
  <p>
   of kings. The marriage was set to take place (they had agreed that no dowry would be
  </p>
  <p>
   paid) and everything needed for the marriage was at hand: canopies fit for a very king,
  </p>
  <p>
   carriages lined with silk and covered in gold, colorful and luxurious clothing for dressing
  </p>
  <p>
   her boy attendants and servants, and many other things of that sort. In purchasing
  </p>
  <p>
   these items the soldier had run up a large debt. When the maiden’s mother got wind of
  </p>
  <p>
   this (she had the sort of keenness that was impossible to deceive), his situation
  </p>
  <p>
   suddenly caused suspicion. “Well now! The debts he’s run up, the money he’s borrowed
  </p>
  <p>
   at interest, and the things he’s bought on credit don’t add up. If he knew where the
  </p>
  <p>
   fountain of gold was, as he claims, he would not need to borrow anything to repay his
  </p>
  <p>
   debts; he would already have the money at hand for purchasing those items. Unless I
  </p>
  <p>
   am mistaken, his boastful words must surely be covering up some deceit.” With
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicion as her entryway, she thus arrived at the lair of his trickery. She summoned the
  </p>
  <p>
   soldier’s creditors and explained her suspicions about him. She advised them to make
  </p>
  <p>
   490
  </p>
  <p>
   sure, by decree of the praetor, that he was taken to jail by force and treated as a debt
  </p>
  <p>
   defaulter and a flight risk. After all, if he brings this remarkable injury upon himself, and
  </p>
  <p>
   then doesn’t produce the money to pay off his debts, the matter is crystal clear: he’s a
  </p>
  <p>
   pure con man.
  </p>
  <p>
   The creditors praised the woman’s advice, thanked her, ran at full speed to the
  </p>
  <p>
   praetor, and communicated their request. The praetor, who found the soldier’s
  </p>
  <p>
   arrogance detestable and had been suspicious of his unlimited wealth, did not dare
  </p>
  <p>
   deny their request, and he ordered the man to be thrown in chains before nightfall
  </p>
  <p>
   unless he paid off his entire debt or provided sufficient collateral. Thus the poor soldier
  </p>
  <p>
   found himself surrounded by lictors before he was able to have the slightest inkling of
  </p>
  <p>
   what was happening, or before the news was somehow able to reach him—especially
  </p>
  <p>
   because he had turned his attention to being cautious. He did not surrender himself into
  </p>
  <p>
   their custody like a timid coward, but drew his sword and attempted to effect his escape
  </p>
  <p>
   with it. But it was all in vain. He was hit over the head by the chief lictor, was forced to
  </p>
  <p>
   stop, and he handed himself over to be tied up and taken to jail by force, where he died
  </p>
  <p>
   of grief a few months later. It later came to light, however, that he had never wanted to
  </p>
  <p>
   get married. How would he have been able to support a wife with such a large
  </p>
  <p>
   household, especially one born to such a lineage, since he himself had no place on
  </p>
  <p>
   earth he could call his own; and since he wasn’t able to amass any gold or silver, except
  </p>
  <p>
   for what he forged out of tricks, deceits, and the resources of others? I repeat, it was
  </p>
  <p>
   only a plan to fleece others out of their gold, right down to their hides, through a
  </p>
  <p>
   pretense of marriage; and, in particular, to trick that very rich merchant out of large
  </p>
  <p>
   quantities of diamonds, each of them worth up to fifty gold coins. If the soldier had been
  </p>
  <p>
   491
  </p>
  <p>
   able to secretly take the diamonds from the merchant, either by entreaty or by
  </p>
  <p>
   pretending to buy them, he had a boat waiting to take him back to his homeland and to
  </p>
  <p>
   resolve the matter by fleeing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead, he used the opportunity of his marriage and wedding for his principal
  </p>
  <p>
   means of stealing them. He said that he really wanted to buy them so he could affix and
  </p>
  <p>
   sew them onto his wife’s dress, which was worked in the Phrygian style.226 He therefore
  </p>
  <p>
   stopped by the merchant’s house frequently, and, bringing along an embroiderer with a
  </p>
  <p>
   small piece of his wife’s dress, he picked up each diamond, inspected it, and tested
  </p>
  <p>
   whether it fit in the gaps of the embroidery pattern. He said that the day of his wedding
  </p>
  <p>
   was drawing near but that he could not pay the cost—nor commit in advance to a
  </p>
  <p>
   specific day when he could pay it—and he insisted, and vehemently demanded, that the
  </p>
  <p>
   man hand over the diamonds. The merchant kept a firm grip on the diamonds saying:
  </p>
  <p>
   “No one will take even a single diamond from me unless he has payment at the ready.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The soldier responded loudly and proudly (as was his wont): “Are you afraid to trust
  </p>
  <p>
   me? Other people have handed over to me a thousand times more, and they were not
  </p>
  <p>
   cheated out of their money. There is no other person alive today who is considered
  </p>
  <p>
   equally and properly credible as I. Don’t you know that I will soon be able to utterly
  </p>
  <p>
   shower you with gold?” “Indeed, that’s how it stands,” said the merchant. “You won’t
  </p>
  <p>
   have the diamonds from me any other way. Take your fancy words out of here. You will
  </p>
  <p>
   never persuade me to trust you today with even one cent.” They say that the soldier
  </p>
  <p>
   gave up immediately when he sensed that trust in him was collapsing.

  </p>
  <p>
   492
  </p>
  <p>
   Then someone who was listening to the story said: “This soldier was defeated by
  </p>
  <p>
   the cunning and wickedness of Geta, who arrived last year from the farthest and most
  </p>
  <p>
   remote regions of the world at that island we just set sail from. He had fallen in love with
  </p>
  <p>
   Philargyria, wife of Agathon the clockmaker, and he sent her gifts, bracelets, stockings,
  </p>
  <p>
   necklaces, earrings, and rings. He took all these things out on loan from his friend the
  </p>
  <p>
   goldsmith. But when Geta had satisfied his desire for her and had become weary of the
  </p>
  <p>
   woman’s greed, he devised a plan by which the items he had given her would be
  </p>
  <p>
   returned whence they had come. And the plan worked perfectly. One day he came to
  </p>
  <p>
   the woman’s house pretending to be distraught. She immediately asked him why he
  </p>
  <p>
   was so sad and agitated. ‘Because I got into a dispute with the goldsmith where I
  </p>
  <p>
   purchased the gifts of gold I gave you. He has clearly gone mad with his prices and
  </p>
  <p>
   feels no shame about it. Because he knows that the gold has flown off to you and that I
  </p>
  <p>
   can’t return it, he’s trying to use the threat of a lawsuit to force me to accept his
  </p>
  <p>
   demands. Sometimes he says he will bring legal action against me, and other times he
  </p>
  <p>
   uses threats of lictors and jail. In sum, he is cruel and mean in many ways. Do you want
  </p>
  <p>
   to play a funny trick on him that will make his eyes hurt? Bring him the gold I gave you
  </p>
  <p>
   so he gets it back. In this way, if he can sell again what he thinks he has already sold,
  </p>
  <p>
   we will indeed have exacted proper revenge. In the meantime, you take this promissory
  </p>
  <p>
   note that a money changer recently brought to my house, and you will immediately get
  </p>
  <p>
   two talents, which you can use to buy new jewelry or, if you prefer, you can loan it out at
  </p>
  <p>
   interest.’ The woman, even though she leaves all other women in her wake, by a long
  </p>
  <p>
   shot, in terms of her cleverness and wickedness, she was nevertheless won over by the
  </p>
  <p>
   hope of greater gain and by the foreigner’s advice. She took the promissory note and
  </p>
  <p>
   493
  </p>
  <p>
   returned all the gifts to him. Geta took them, returned them to the goldsmith, who had
  </p>
  <p>
   loaned them to him, and made for his fatherland with all possible speed. The woman
  </p>
  <p>
   who had been deceived, on the other hand, counted her coins in her dreams.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While we were laughing at the woman, whom the foreign man had so nicely
  </p>
  <p>
   duped, a small boat powered by oars was swiftly approaching us. Indeed, neither birds
  </p>
  <p>
   nor winds moved faster. When it got close to us, we caught sight of a man in chains
  </p>
  <p>
   sitting in the midst of four lictors. The ship’s captain recognized him immediately and
  </p>
  <p>
   said: “They are bringing in the sexton of the Temple of Apollo by force. He has been
  </p>
  <p>
   brought back from his escape, or rather, he is being brought to sentencing and
  </p>
  <p>
   punishment.” With the usual vice of the human race, we burned with desire to find out
  </p>
  <p>
   from the ship’s captain what capital crime he was found guilty of being involved in. The
  </p>
  <p>
   ship’s captain willingly complied with our wish and said: “This sexton loved, to the point
  </p>
  <p>
   of insanity, a beautiful, freeborn boy (he has a penchant for such things) and after
  </p>
  <p>
   pursuing him tirelessly, he painstakingly arranged to lure the boy to his bedroom. But he
  </p>
  <p>
   was not able to succeed because the boy knew why he was being summoned and
  </p>
  <p>
   continually invented new excuses for why he could not come. The sexton, driven by a
  </p>
  <p>
   burning desire as if by the Furies, contrived the following plan to draw the boy to him,
  </p>
  <p>
   albeit unwillingly.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The boy had a pet falcon that he had trained so well that, when he sent it forth
  </p>
  <p>
   into the air, it would come back to him with prey in its talons. While the boy was away
  </p>
  <p>
   from his house, the sexton concerned himself with getting the falcon delivered to him,
  </p>
  <p>
   so he sent men to insist, on the boy’s behalf, that the falcon be handed over to him. The
  </p>
  <p>
   boy, he said, was intent on catching birds at a small country house near the city, and
  </p>
  <p>
   494
  </p>
  <p>
   that he very much desired to hunt prey with his falcon. Unsuspecting, his family handed
  </p>
  <p>
   the falcon over without delay. When the boy came home to find his falcon missing, he
  </p>
  <p>
   asked what had happened to it. His family said that they had given it to the man whom
  </p>
  <p>
   he had sent from the nearby country house where he was hunting birds. The boy cried
  </p>
  <p>
   and wailed and said that he had never set eyes on that country house, that he had not
  </p>
  <p>
   organized any bird hunt, and that he had not sent anyone over. ‘But wherever it is, it
  </p>
  <p>
   cannot be kept hidden for long. I will suss it out. I will break down everyone’s doors, and
  </p>
  <p>
   I will search every corner of every house.’
  </p>
  <p>
   “But the sexton happened upon the boy as he was searching and said: ‘I know
  </p>
  <p>
   what you are looking for. Make your search worthwhile: your falcon is at my house, so
  </p>
  <p>
   please come. I will not stand in the way of your getting it back forthwith.’ The boy, for
  </p>
  <p>
   whom time had never seemed to pass so slowly as while he was waiting to have his
  </p>
  <p>
   falcon returned,227 and not concerned with anything else, followed the sexton as he
  </p>
  <p>
   went ahead and entered his bedroom. The sexton immediately bolted the door shut and
  </p>
  <p>
   pitifully begged the boy, with many entreaties, compliments, and promises, to succumb
  </p>
  <p>
   to his desires. Hearing these things, the poor boy at last realized that he had fallen into
  </p>
  <p>
   a trap (he had never before feared anything quite so much as this), and he tearfully
  </p>
  <p>
   began to implore the man to keep the falcon and to just let him go.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The sexton, in order to render the boy obedient to his wishes, alternated
  </p>
  <p>
   between mollifying him with promises and terrorizing him with threats. But when this
  </p>
  <p>
   didn’t succeed, he resorted to force, and he pulled out two spears, one which was made

   of iron and the other one (pardon the expression) extended out from between his legs, a
  </p>
  <p>
   duplicate of—and very similar in size and shape to—the one that makes the god of
  </p>
  <p>
   Lampsacus especially fierce and terrifying.228 He said: ‘Choose whichever one you
  </p>
  <p>
   want. Whether you want to or not, you much choose one or the other.’ The appearance
  </p>
  <p>
   of his terrifying member made the boy undecided as to which one he should surrender
  </p>
  <p>
   to in meeting his death—the sword or that detestable rod. He was not sure which of the
  </p>
  <p>
   two he would receive less injury from.
  </p>
  <p>
   “While he was deliberating, the sexton received a message from the high priest
  </p>
  <p>
   of the temple telling him to set aside all business and to hasten to him at full speed,
  </p>
  <p>
   because the high priest needed to meet with him. Upon being summoned, the sexton
  </p>
  <p>
   hurried off. The boy, freed from all fear, thanked the gods, arrived home without his
  </p>
  <p>
   falcon, and, almost beside himself with fear, told his father everything that had
  </p>
  <p>
   happened. He said: ‘Although he was unaware of his good deed, if that good priest had
  </p>
  <p>
   not intervened, you would be arranging a funeral for your son today because at this very
  </p>
  <p>
   moment I would be split in two and broken by that frightful spear.’ The father, incited by
  </p>
  <p>
   rage, went to the high priest, told him about the sexton’s shameful act, and said that he
  </p>
  <p>
   owed the boy’s life first to the gods and then to him, because he had summoned that
  </p>
  <p>
   pervert away. Otherwise his son would have been killed by the greatest form of torture
  </p>
  <p>
   and would now be dead. The high priest was greatly offended at the wickedness of his
  </p>
  <p>
   sexton, and he dismissed the boy’s father with encouraging words and, at the same
  </p>
  <p>
   time, promised he would see to it that no harm would ever come to his son in the future
  </p>
  <p>
   228 = Priapus, whose cult started in the Greek colony of Lampsacus in Asia Minor before spreading to
  </p>
  <p>
   mainland Greece and then to Italy. This part about the “second sword” (his penis), and the “terrifying
  </p>
  <p>
   member” was removed from the 1645 edition likely because it was too salacious.
  </p>
  <p>
   496
  </p>
  <p>
   at the hands of that man. The high priest did not wait for his anger to subside, but he
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately sent for the sexton and, as was fitting, scolded him and ordered him to
  </p>
  <p>
   return the falcon to the boy immediately and to leave the city—and even the whole
  </p>
  <p>
   island—before nightfall. The sexton heard this order, but, full of rage and malice, he
  </p>
  <p>
   went to the boy’s home when the boy’s father was conveniently away and called for him
  </p>
  <p>
   outside the gate. By chance, at that very moment, the boy was in the throes of colic and
  </p>
  <p>
   confined to his bed, so he was unable to go outside. The sexton, while he was handing
  </p>
  <p>
   the falcon over to a maidservant, pulled out a knife that he kept hidden under his cloak
  </p>
  <p>
   and said: ‘If he had come out, the boy would have gotten this entire knife in his gut,
  </p>
  <p>
   because it’s his fault that I’m being thrown out into exile.’ And he immediately packed up
  </p>
  <p>
   all the silver bowls, dishes, jugs, drinking vessels, and the boxes for incense he used for
  </p>
  <p>
   the sacred rites to Apollo, and he secretly fled to the adjacent island, which was under
  </p>
  <p>
   our jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>
   “When he got there, he broke the sacred vessels upon an iron plate that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   begged off of the innkeeper where he was lodging, with the intention of refining them in
  </p>
  <p>
   a fire and melting them into a single lump of silver. The items had barely touched the
  </p>
  <p>
   fire when a din, a crash, a loud noise, and a crack of thunder rang out so suddenly, so
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly and powerfully, that the house seemed to be caving in. The innkeeper and his
  </p>
  <p>
   entire family rushed over and looked at the plate that had been placed on the fire,
  </p>
  <p>
   together with the shards of the dishes, and they saw that the crashing noise had thrown
  </p>
  <p>
   that sacrilegious man to the ground. They picked him up and handed him over to the
  </p>
  <p>
   magistrates who put him in jail. He was ordered to plead his case before them in chains.
  </p>
  <p>
   He is being sent to the high priest of the temple he plundered so he can be put on trial
  </p>
  <p>
   497
  </p>
  <p>
   according to law, or rather, so punishment can be exacted from the confessed criminal.”
  </p>
  <p>
   A certain person was listening to this, who, from the way his eyebrows were knit
  </p>
  <p>
   together like a cloud, his long beard, and his black teeth, we understood to be a wise
  </p>
  <p>
   man. He drew a deep breath and poured forth these wise words against wanton love
  </p>
  <p>
   affairs”:
  </p>
  <p>
   Alas, who can count the things that an irrational lover endures? Ah,
  </p>
  <p>
   sometimes not even grievous death is as dark! A lover often mourns the
  </p>
  <p>
   joys that he has been deprived of—poor man—and often grieves and
  </p>
  <p>
   laments his wounded faith. He asks: Do mortal minds engage only in false
  </p>
  <p>
   oaths? Believe nothing, O trusting man. Does pleasure, that is so slow to
  </p>
  <p>
   come, flee so quickly? Is this pain so firmly set in my mind? Indeed, this
  </p>
  <p>
   statement is true: harmful things are made of hard marble, whereas (one
  </p>
  <p>
   might say) good things are made of fragile clay. But if you enjoy steadfast
  </p>
  <p>
   and simple pleasure, it can only be summoned from heavenly places. Or if
  </p>
  <p>
   you seek a mate and a similar disposition in love, your mind must rest
  </p>
  <p>
   wholly in God’s kindness; from this alone can mutual ardor take hold—the
  </p>
  <p>
   rest is just deceit by secret tricks, and you will not draw true solace, or joy
  </p>
  <p>
   untainted with impure stains, from anywhere except heaven. But as for the
  </p>
  <p>
   things that shine brightly, as soon as you see them change appearance
  </p>
  <p>
   (mark my words), you will wish you had never touched them. They
  </p>
  <p>
   become unsettled and are similar to a clear sky that does not show its
  </p>
  <p>
   lovely face forever. Oh, how many times did the day, which had been
  </p>
  <p>
   cloudless, seem suddenly to become enveloped in a black fog! How many
  </p>
  <p>
   people do you see, who are happy and confident in their prosperous
  </p>
  <p>
   affairs, later wet their cheeks with tears! We are spun about in the quickly
  </p>
  <p>
   whirling wheel of Fortune, like a ship on the open sea, while the South
  </p>
  <p>
   Wind rages. For now, after leaping up and striking the wandering stars,
  </p>
  <p>
   the ship heads down toward deepest Tartarus at a swift clip. How often
  </p>
  <p>
   has a man just been seen in his gold-plated halls, only then to be forced to
  </p>
  <p>
   depart, a pauper, for a lowly house! Therefore, no faith should be placed
  </p>
  <p>
   in vain things, which cause harm when mixed with wicked shame. Safe
  </p>
  <p>
   and secure, strive for the gifts of the mind; for these things remain firm
  </p>
  <p>
   while everything else changes frequently. As long as you are able, fill your
  </p>
  <p>
   mind with noble virtues and spend your days innocently and without
  </p>
  <p>
   blemish. But waste no time, for the years will pass and somber death will
  </p>
  <p>
   arrive quickly on dark feet; afterward your faults will strike you with belated
  </p>
  <p>
   shame and with even more fear, if that shame hits a guilty heart. If the
  </p>
  <p>
   hours of a misspent lifetime return through my devotions, with what
  </p>
  <p>
   prayers would I wish to beg the gods, after being restored to myself, to
  </p>
  <p>
   repay the damage I have done; and with what prayers could I strive to
  </p>
  <p>
   have new hope in my heart? Are you without fault? If you think back, god
  </p>
  <p>
   498
  </p>
  <p>
   was always present to us and new labors remain to be performed, even in
  </p>
  <p>
   the wake of misfortunes: infernal dwellings, fierce Tisiphone, savage
  </p>
  <p>
   monsters horrifying with snakes, black rivers flowing with sulphurous
  </p>
  <p>
   streams, and eternal tears flowing endlessly from your eyes. Prayers by
  </p>
  <p>
   no means move their hard hearts, and any way out is closed to those poor
  </p>
  <p>
   souls, as is the power of salvation; for the doors are firmly sealed shut with
  </p>
  <p>
   hard iron. So do not let the eyes or hair of a young girl harm you, blunt
  </p>
  <p>
   your keenness, or let your honor be undergirded by a misdeed. Truly, if
  </p>
  <p>
   filthy love oppresses you, take the initiative of freeing your neck from the
  </p>
  <p>
   yoke that is holding you captive, and when you have expelled that filthy
  </p>
  <p>
   fire from your pure heart, such passion will no longer burn you with a
  </p>
  <p>
   similar flame.
  </p>
  <p>
   It seemed like he would have said more if a fight, which had broken out among
  </p>
  <p>
   the sailors, had not called the entire group of people away from him. Everyone went
  </p>
  <p>
   over to calm the fight down. And so, abandoned by his audience, he fell silent and did
  </p>
  <p>
   not finish his poem, which he had begun and was taking pains to bring to a close. We,
  </p>
  <p>
   on the other hand, were left on the deck of the ship and were pounced on by one of
  </p>
  <p>
   those philosophers, who we said before had promised their chastity to Minerva. If you
  </p>
  <p>
   had seen his face you would have thought him a worthy man. Indeed, there was such a
  </p>
  <p>
   seriousness to his expression and gravity in his gait, that you would have said he was
  </p>
  <p>
   Socrates or Xenocrates or one of the ancient philosophers who, on account of their
  </p>
  <p>
   incredible will-power and innate tendency for self-control, had a direct path to virtue. He
  </p>
  <p>
   approached us, wished us well, and then said: “I know you! I often saw you walking
  </p>
  <p>
   along the street with Gallonius. What were you thinking leaving that city when it isn’t
  </p>
  <p>
   easy to find another one in the entire world more charming or more filled with
  </p>
  <p>
   pleasures? Every kind of love, desire, beauty, charm, delight, sport, and jest dwell there
  </p>
  <p>
   and participate in its delights. The destructiveness, distraction, and discord of so many
  </p>
  <p>
   pleasures the city has to offer came down on me (poor thing!), and I was violently
  </p>
  <p>
   removed from it. When I tore myself away and set foot aboard this ship, I felt that a part
  </p>
  <p>
   499
  </p>
  <p>
   of my insides was being ripped out of me. But it couldn’t be any other way. I was being
  </p>
  <p>
   pressured by the order of my superior and had to yield to his moral authority. He is
  </p>
  <p>
   sending me to the neighboring island in order to propagate our religious order and, in
  </p>
  <p>
   particular, to sow in men’s hearts a love of chastity by way of frequent sermons before
  </p>
  <p>
   the people.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But, as I understand it, you did not have a guide to help you seek out and
  </p>
  <p>
   identify the city’s pleasures. If you had had me as your teacher, what realms of pleasure
  </p>
  <p>
   and delight would I have led you to! But I can’t do more than point out the signs and
  </p>
  <p>
   indications of the locales where, once you are familiar with them (if you ever find
  </p>
  <p>
   yourselves in the city again), you can mine countless pleasures, as you would gold, and
  </p>
  <p>
   find them without error. Make sure that my words remain fixed in your tenacious mind;
  </p>
  <p>
   memory is fleeting unless it is retained by the aid of letters. Do you have writing tablets
  </p>
  <p>
   and a pen on you?” “No,” I replied, “but we have notebooks.” “All right,” he replied, “Go
  </p>
  <p>
   ahead and write this down: If you enjoy the cleanest prostitutes, go to madam Claereta
  </p>
  <p>
   in the Vicus Tuscus. She will bring you a group of girls who are healthy, compliant, very
  </p>
  <p>
   beautiful, very young, and (most importantly) barely passed around in public—and she
  </p>
  <p>
   will bring so many of them that you can have a new lover every day. If you prefer
  </p>
  <p>
   virgins, look for Phanostrata in the Forum Boarium. She always has some nice morsel
  </p>
  <p>
   stashed away at her house that she can send your way when you arrive. Or if you find
  </p>
  <p>
   something you love on your own, she will make you see how useful she can be in these
  </p>
  <p>
   matters. She is so eloquent that she can draw even the Vestal Virgins out from their
  </p>
  <p>
   enclosures. If noble married women are your cup of tea, for this you should look no
  </p>
  <p>
   farther than Angellus of our religious order. He is the only one who has all of the
  </p>
  <p>
   500
  </p>
  <p>
   matrons in the city at his beck and call, and he can tell you how each one’s feet, thighs,
  </p>
  <p>
   arms, and buttocks are. Although he is extremely dutiful, he is equally mindful of his
  </p>
  <p>
   own needs, and he hardly ever presents any woman to someone else for enjoyment
  </p>
  <p>
   whom he has not first tried himself. Therefore, on account of the regard he has for me,
  </p>
  <p>
   he will provide you with matrons of the highest social rank and the greatest beauty with
  </p>
  <p>
   whom you can derive the greatest pleasures. But our avowed worship of Minerva,
  </p>
  <p>
   goddess of the greatest nations, is calling me away from you. We venerate her with
  </p>
  <p>
   certain prayers, so that she will be propitious and not allow any blemish to stain the
  </p>
  <p>
   chastity that we profess.” As he was leaving, Paulus Aemilius said: “We thank you, and
  </p>
  <p>
   if we ever return to the city—to such a vast sea of pleasures as you describe—we, who
  </p>
  <p>
   are inexperienced and unskilled, will stay afloat with the raft you have provided us.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When he was out of sight, a man, who had secretly overheard his words, said: “O
  </p>
  <p>
   tempora, o mores! Who can you trust your wife with? Who can you entrust your children
  </p>
  <p>
   to for an education? That man would form their tender minds with the same precepts he
  </p>
  <p>
   just tried to instill in you. And he, who is supposedly so reserved, is sent to foreign
  </p>
  <p>
   countries to praise chastity! That man, whom his entire audience treats as if he has just
  </p>
  <p>
   sprung forth from the very bosom of Minerva when he starts speaking, denounces
  </p>
  <p>
   crimes of passion with vigor, intensity of conviction, and seriousness of words and
  </p>
  <p>
   determination. As soon he has concluded his speech, however, if he comes across a
  </p>
  <p>
   maiden or matron he can have sex with, he immediately demonstrates, in that situation,
  </p>
  <p>
   what his own will and feelings are regarding that entire matter. Angellus, whom we
  </p>
  <p>
   mentioned, is ashamed to talk about the abominable things he had a hand in. The
  </p>
  <p>
   scandalous things he has done could be distributed, man by man, over the entire
  </p>
  <p>
   501
  </p>
  <p>
   population. He has ruined the purity of so many matrons! He has brought disgrace upon
  </p>
  <p>
   many chaste women and dishonor upon many virgins!”
  </p>
  <p>
   And the man would have dragged his speech out longer, had he not been
  </p>
  <p>
   interrupted by the auspicious voices of people calling out: “Well done! Oh good! He’s
  </p>
  <p>
   here, he’s here!” We looked up and saw about thirty triremes heading toward us at a
  </p>
  <p>
   fast clip. They were said to be carrying Dynast Parthenius,229 a leading citizen
  </p>
  <p>
   abounding in every advantage of nature and fortune, who had been admitted into that
  </p>
  <p>
   religious order not long before and was now on his way to rule that republic230 along
  </p>
  <p>
   with the other dynasts. The great virtues of that leading citizen—unanimously exalted to
  </p>
  <p>
   the heavens by everyone, with the highest words of praise—infused in us a desire to get
  </p>
  <p>
   to know him, not just by some birthmark, so to speak, but by his whole body. Each of us
  </p>
  <p>
   eagerly tried to act on our desire, but in the end, the eloquence of a person more suited
  </p>
  <p>
   to this task won out. He said: “If I wanted to relate everything that can be said about that
  </p>
  <p>
   man, I would run out of days before I ran out of words. Elected to take the place of a
  </p>
  <p>
   deceased dynast, he lends more grandeur to that position than he will receive from it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the rank of dynast is equally available to the highest and lowest men (and a
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast is not considered any greater because he comes to that rank from the highest or
  </p>
  <p>
   lowest station), nevertheless some dynasts are greatly superior to others in praise and
  </p>
  <p>
   glory. This man, born from a long and a clearly immeasurable line of great kings, in the
  </p>
  <p>
   very flower of his youth, and at the point of greatest abundance in all of his attributes,
  </p>
  <p>
   imposed a condition of abstinence and the highest virtue upon himself. If we are to
  </p>
  <p>
   229 Giachino (2002: 200) identifies this person as Fabio Chigi, later Pope Alexander VII (1599-1667), but it
  </p>
  <p>
   could also be Pope Urban VIII or Cardinal Francesco Barberini.
  </p>
  <p>
   230 = Eudemia
  </p>
  <p>
   502
  </p>
  <p>
   imagine a dynast from whom every blemish has been removed, and who is rich in every
  </p>
  <p>
   merit, this man was certainly the very model and character of a dynast. And just as
  </p>
  <p>
   there is nothing of any sort so perfect that it is not excelled in perfection by the original
  </p>
  <p>
   of which it is a copy—like a mask is a copy of a face—in the same way, if anyone
  </p>
  <p>
   should form or fashion himself to imitate that dynast’s life, that person would be judged
  </p>
  <p>
   far inferior to him in terms of excellence. That dynast has no hiding places lurking in his
  </p>
  <p>
   mind and no recesses for concealing treachery. He has no plans for trickery drawn up in
  </p>
  <p>
   his heart. He harbors a mindset that is not darkened by malevolence, not accustomed to
  </p>
  <p>
   lies, not counterfeit, not deceitful, and not educated in the arts of pretense. Of his own
  </p>
  <p>
   accord he cultivates piety, religion, and justice, and he does not do so for some profit or
  </p>
  <p>
   advantage. Moreover, he excels in talent, education, and learning. Crowds of learned
  </p>
  <p>
   men frequent his villa, so much so that it is considered a veritable workshop of wisdom
  </p>
  <p>
   where an academy was immediately formed from the flowering of all the minds that
  </p>
  <p>
   gather there.231 Those who are ruled by a zeal for the most refined arts are marvelously
  </p>
  <p>
   delighted, and they profit from these men’s most learned orations.”
  </p>
  <p>
   As we were listening intently, we were interrupted by the sudden boisterous
  </p>
  <p>
   laughter and hissing of the sailors. The ship’s captain, a sensible man, knew why they
  </p>
  <p>
   were laughing, and he put a stop to it with a harsh reprimand and ordered them to be
  </p>
  <p>
   quiet. When they looked around they saw four triremes carrying a few dynasts back with
  </p>
  <p>
   all possible speed to the kingdom of Geryon, whence they had come, to the assembly of
  </p>
  <p>
   231 This mention of an academy, born from the great minds who gathered at this man’s villa, might lead
  </p>
  <p>
   the reader to think of Paolo Mancini, the founder of the Accademia degli Umoristi (mentioned in Book
  </p>
  <p>
   Three); but the fulsome praise of this man for his honesty, piety, and religion seems excessive with
  </p>
  <p>
   regards to Mancini. Perhaps the villa mentioned here is Palazzo Barberini, also a locus for many literary,
  </p>
  <p>
   musical, and artistic gatherings.
  </p>
  <p>
   503
  </p>
  <p>
   the Rex Sacrorum. They had been persuaded to go there by some mathematicians
  </p>
  <p>
   who, from the position of the stars, had predicted that the king, who was in power at that
  </p>
  <p>
   time, was destined for the Underworld within a few days.232 When they had seen that a
  </p>
  <p>
   month had passed from the time of that prediction, and that there seemed to be no hope
  </p>
  <p>
   that Minos had drawn the king’s lot from his urn in the Underworld, they were returning
  </p>
  <p>
   back whence they had departed, despondent and devoid of laughter.
  </p>
  <p>
   While everyone was engaging in delights, conviviality and joy, we saw one man
  </p>
  <p>
   standing apart from the rest who was sad, kept his head lowered, and was gazing at the
  </p>
  <p>
   floor. Paulus Aemilius, either out of pity or because of the flaw in men who, wasting
  </p>
  <p>
   away with idleness, concern themselves with other people’s business, approached him
  </p>
  <p>
   and asked why he was so forlorn. While the rest were giving themselves over to joy,
  </p>
  <p>
   why was he furrowing his brow as if to mock the happiness of others? He replied: “My
  </p>
  <p>
   charming neighbor, who arranged for me to marry his sister, is the cause of my misery.
  </p>
  <p>
   After he had paid out her dowry at my house (namely fifty minae), he placed the maiden
  </p>
  <p>
   under my legal control.233 Enflamed with the desire to have her as soon as possible
  </p>
  <p>
   (she’s not bad looking), and also to consummate our nuptials, I withdrew with my new
  </p>
  <p>
   bride to the bedroom and, not thinking, I left the silver that had been counted out there
  </p>
  <p>
   on the table. While I was inside enjoying myself with her, that good man took the money
  </p>
  <p>
   and secretly ran out of the house, leaving me with nothing but tears. I am now headed
  </p>
  <p>
   232 Urban VIII believed in astrology and had horoscopes read that predicted the death of certain cardinals
  </p>
  <p>
   in Rome. Beginning in 1626 astrologers predicted Urban VIII’s own death, and by 1628 these predictions
  </p>
  <p>
   were talked about openly. In 1631 he published a bull against astrologers (Walker 2000: 205-6; Giachino
  </p>
  <p>
   2002: 204).
  </p>
  <p>
   233 “Manus” in juridical terms is a husband’s legal control over his wife in marriage. See Chapter 2, n. 517
  </p>
  <p>
   for an explanation of the two kinds of marriage, “cum manu” and “sine manu.”
  </p>
  <p>
   504
  </p>
  <p>
   to the neighboring island where they say he has fled, so I can pursue what was taken
  </p>
  <p>
   from me via the law and a legal judgment, or rather, so I can take that thief’s life.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Paulus Aemilius responded: “Truly, you are shamefully stupid. You are seeking revenge
  </p>
  <p>
   for something bad with something good, an injury with a benefit. You cannot thank him
  </p>
  <p>
   enough for his kindness, because he gave you a wife who will be as gentle as a sheep.
  </p>
  <p>
   She will not lean on her dowry to become emboldened in the future, but she will revere
  </p>
  <p>
   you as a master, she will fear you, and she will be obliging in all things. Therefore,
  </p>
  <p>
   banish that cloud from your brow and allow yourself to be happy with the others. Heed
  </p>
  <p>
   my advice and go home; if your wife is as wonderful as you say, since there are so
  </p>
  <p>
   many pleasure-seekers and rich people around, the gift bearers among them will be
  </p>
  <p>
   gathering the troops at your house.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While Paulus Aemilius was trying with all his might to console the poor man,
  </p>
  <p>
   another one came forward who was just as forlorn, saying: “This man’s dowry may have
  </p>
  <p>
   slipped out of his hands, but my wife slipped out of mine—and after she fled she was
  </p>
  <p>
   nowhere to be found. Therefore, which one of us lives a more miserable life?” Paulus
  </p>
  <p>
   Aemilius responded: “Really, she fled? Yours and your relatives’ watchfulness should
  </p>
  <p>
   have guarded her more carefully. If you had done that, you would not now be
  </p>
  <p>
   complaining that she got away.” Then he said: “I even had too tight a grip on her.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because I loved her desperately, and because the frequent comings and goings of
  </p>
  <p>
   young men past my house every day made me suspicious of her, I didn’t allow her to
  </p>
  <p>
   set foot outside the house, even the width of a fingernail. Argus didn’t guard the cow
  </p>
  <p>
   Juno, who was entrusted to him, as well as I made sure to keep a close eye on what
  </p>
  <p>
   was mine. My trade gave me a talent in this area. I am the kind of chef who, unlike
  </p>
  <p>
   505
  </p>
  <p>
   others, never cooks outside my home, but I season what is brought to my house with
  </p>
  <p>
   care and with such pleasantness that my food can please even the dead. For this
  </p>
  <p>
   reason I am never lacking for work. However, during the most recent night festival in
  </p>
  <p>
   honor of Ceres, my wife begged me, with all her heart, to take her to the Temple of
  </p>
  <p>
   Ceres, and she spoke so sweetly that she talked me into it. I get up just before dawn,
  </p>
  <p>
   enclose Vulcan in my horn,234 and order her to follow me as I walk ahead. We go there
  </p>
  <p>
   and we enter a narrow lane that is filthy and muddy. Attentively, I caution her not to step
  </p>
  <p>
   in the mud, and I say: ‘Leonica (that is her name), watch out for the mud! Watch out for
  </p>
  <p>
   the mud, Leonica!’ I looked back, but Leonica had already flown out of my sight. Out of
  </p>
  <p>
   breath, I ran and followed her as she was racing ahead—but it was no use! I wasn’t able
  </p>
  <p>
   to keep up with her, since she was hidden by the advantage of night. Nonetheless, I
  </p>
  <p>
   spared no labor or effort in searching—she is too dear to my heart—but I crawled
  </p>
  <p>
   through the whole town, to the Temple of Ceres, to my friends’ houses—where did I not
  </p>
  <p>
   go? Now I have decided to visit all of the islands surrounding this kingdom in search of
  </p>
  <p>
   her, and I will not stop looking until I have found her. And when I have found her I will
  </p>
  <p>
   bring her back home with me.” Then Paulus Aemilius said: “You fool. Are you
  </p>
  <p>
   complaining that you have been freed from annoyance and expense? If you are so
  </p>
  <p>
   troubled that your wife is gone, and if she is the source of your greatest joy, give the
  </p>
  <p>
   dowry you received from your wife to this man, and you take his wife off of his hands. If
  </p>
  <p>
   he is wise, he will restore your enjoyment to you, and he will manage without her. In this
  </p>
  <p>
   way each of you gets what you want: he gets a dowry and you get a wife. Good day.”
  </p>
  <p>
   234 Vulcan is the god of fire, who in this case stands for the flame in the lantern itself, which is made of
  </p>
  <p>
   horn; in other words, he lit a lamp.
  </p>
  <p>
   506
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, out to sea they saw the island in the distance from where, as
  </p>
  <p>
   we said, the sexton had been brought back after his flight. The captain decided to put
  </p>
  <p>
   the ship ashore on the island so he could purchase the superior wine that is produced
  </p>
  <p>
   there and load it onto his ship. We approached and entered the port where we heard
  </p>
  <p>
   about the death of a young man, whom Dynast Vius loved and considered his darling,
  </p>
  <p>
   and who had driven himself (by his own stupidity) into a state of poverty and need after
  </p>
  <p>
   having the greatest wealth, with which he had been enriched by Vius. They were
  </p>
  <p>
   discussing the time when this young man was once employed as a page boy in the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast’s household. On account of his extreme arrogance and insolence, no one could
  </p>
  <p>
   tolerate the young man and he was ordered to leave that house as soon as possible
  </p>
  <p>
   and go to the devil. Deprived of any support, the young man took himself back to his
  </p>
  <p>
   homeland. There, since he did not desist in his arrogance and insolence, but
  </p>
  <p>
   perpetrated unheard-of acts on a daily basis, they say he was dragged off in chains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Making use of his customary audacity, he broke free of the chains and came back from
  </p>
  <p>
   his flight to his dynast, and he put his mind—through his friends and go-betweens, all of
  </p>
  <p>
   whom were eminent men—to being reinstated to his former place of friendship and
  </p>
  <p>
   favor with the dynast, thanks to his friends’ esteem. The dynast responded frankly that
  </p>
  <p>
   he would put up with anything before he would host such a man at his house.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, deprived of hope, the young man decided to try his hand at new fortunes
  </p>
  <p>
   and to find new friendships, and he immediately boarded a small boat. It is important to
  </p>
  <p>
   understand, however, how Neptune—who understood that the fortune the young man
  </p>
  <p>
   was seeking was located in the country he was leaving—drove him back from the sea to
  </p>
  <p>
   the shore. Because the winds were blowing hard, the small boat had already sped out
  </p>
  <p>
   507
  </p>
  <p>
   of sight when Neptune ordered Aeolus to signal a retreat; to check the winds that were
  </p>
  <p>
   favorable to his voyage by confining them in chains; and instead to release winds that
  </p>
  <p>
   were unfavorable for sailing, which would agitate the sea and drive the small boat back
  </p>
  <p>
   to the same place whence it had set sail. Aeolus obeyed Neptune’s orders, released the
  </p>
  <p>
   winds from their confinement, and sent them out to sea. The winds had barely broken
  </p>
  <p>
   free when they assaulted and attacked the boat, turned it around, and forced it to return
  </p>
  <p>
   whence it had left. Tossed out onto the beach, destitute, and just about in rags, the
  </p>
  <p>
   young man had no hope, no resources, and no plan which he could adopt to help his
  </p>
  <p>
   situation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dynast Vius was out of town during that time enjoying the delights of his country
  </p>
  <p>
   estate. A young man named Styliolus was there, who at that time held a very strong
  </p>
  <p>
   position with the dynast because of his influence and charm. (The dynast always chose
  </p>
  <p>
   someone idle, weak, of low birth, and a no-name as his confidant, on whom he could
  </p>
  <p>
   lavish great rewards of money; transform from a poor man into a rich one; and whom he
  </p>
  <p>
   could render not obedient to his word so much as dominant over him.) The young man
  </p>
  <p>
   was hoping, therefore, if he received letters of commendation from Styliolus addressed
  </p>
  <p>
   to the dynast, that he would easily obtain what he wanted. Thus, he approached
  </p>
  <p>
   Styliolus with cunning and wickedness and told him the following: “Rumor has it that I
  </p>
  <p>
   committed an offense, and that I was thrown out of the dynast’s house because of it. In
  </p>
  <p>
   addition, the matter also brought great disfavor and contempt upon me in everyone’s
  </p>
  <p>
   eyes. I beg and plead with you to help me erase this blemish that has attached itself to
  </p>
  <p>
   my name and has ruined my every thought, counsel, and hope. With you advocating on
  </p>
  <p>
   my behalf, the dynast won’t dare refuse anyone anything. Write to him and tell him that
  </p>
  <p>
   508
  </p>
  <p>
   he should bring me, for a period of one month and no longer, into the position and rank
  </p>
  <p>
   of attendant. When the month is up, I will consider myself as having fulfilled my
  </p>
  <p>
   obligation; and, if you will allow it, as if discharged from his service, I will enter your
  </p>
  <p>
   household as your servant, as though on a new tour of duty.” Styliolus, puffed up and
  </p>
  <p>
   full of boasting, thought that it would be a mark of pride for him if it became public
  </p>
  <p>
   knowledge that men were seeking close association with him and rejecting association
  </p>
  <p>
   with dynasts—which is considered to be especially honorable among those sorts of
  </p>
  <p>
   people—in order to gain benefits and influence. He therefore takes the prideful young
  </p>
  <p>
   man on and passes a letter to the dynast in which he lays everything out. With all his
  </p>
  <p>
   might, Styliolus begs the dynast to allow himself to be won over and to fulfill the wishes
  </p>
  <p>
   of the young man. He said that nothing would please the young man more than if he
  </p>
  <p>
   thought the dynast loved him as much as Styliolus felt he did. Styliolus signs and seals
  </p>
  <p>
   the letter and gives it to the young man. The young man brings the letter immediately to
  </p>
  <p>
   the dynast (who, as we said, was in the countryside at the time), not hesitating to make
  </p>
  <p>
   the twelve-mile journey in the height of summer at high noon. After the dynast read the
  </p>
  <p>
   letter he was persuaded by the enthusiastic commendation, exclaiming: “I’ll grant
  </p>
  <p>
   Styliolus his wish, but he must understand that this man, whom he is so eager to
  </p>
  <p>
   commend, will one day be the ruin of his fortunes.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon, the dynast began to pay the young man every honor, that is to say, when
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone was standing before him with their hats doffed out of respect (as was the
  </p>
  <p>
   custom in those parts), he gave the nod to the young man alone to keep his head
  </p>
  <p>
   covered; to him alone he entrusted his plans; to him alone he entrusted any affairs that
  </p>
  <p>
   held any advantage or honor; he held him in great esteem; he summoned him as his
  </p>
  <p>
   509
  </p>
  <p>
   sole dinner guest, as his companion in his bedroom, and as the one who sits by his side
  </p>
  <p>
   in his carriage. When Styliolus learned all of this from many people’s letters and from
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone’s talk, he was, of course, understandably very perturbed. He wrote to the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast saying that he was greatly surprised that he had not yet sent the youth back to
  </p>
  <p>
   him, and that a month had already gone by, at which point the young man had bound
  </p>
  <p>
   himself to him (Styliolus) as if by a sort of oath. The dynast handed the letter to the
  </p>
  <p>
   young man and commanded him to reply to Styliolus’s demands in whatever way he
  </p>
  <p>
   deemed best. The young man immediately responded to Styliolus that he could not
  </p>
  <p>
   wonder enough at his impudence, or rather his stupidity, because he was demanding
  </p>
  <p>
   services from him—as if he were some hired hand—who employed many people in his
  </p>
  <p>
   house, who were of more respectable origin and family than Styliolus himself was, and
  </p>
  <p>
   who cleaned the latrines for him. For this reason, Styliolus should watch his back if he
  </p>
  <p>
   knew what was good for him; and if he continued to pester him, he would come to
  </p>
  <p>
   understand who he was dealing with; and that he would decide which of the two of them
  </p>
  <p>
   was the fool.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the dynast returned to the city from the countryside, he continued with—
  </p>
  <p>
   and even increased—his gifts and, day by day, he offered ever greater tokens of his
  </p>
  <p>
   great love toward the young man. He even ordered a bedroom be prepared for the
  </p>
  <p>
   young man, decorated with all manner of accoutrements, and placed next to the room
  </p>
  <p>
   where Styliolus usually slept. But get a load of that young man’s arrogance and
  </p>
  <p>
   contempt. Driven wild by the favors shown by his master, and by dancing and running
  </p>
  <p>
   around all day and night, the young man drove Styliolus to the point that he could not
  </p>
  <p>
   sleep, and he was not able to give his attention to any other matter. The din, clatter, and
  </p>
  <p>
   510
  </p>
  <p>
   noise were so loud that the room seemed to be collapsing in on his head, along with
  </p>
  <p>
   that entire wing of the house. Styliolus went often to the dynast to complain about these
  </p>
  <p>
   offenses but did not get any response out of him, other than that the young man was
  </p>
  <p>
   only a boy, and moreover that boys’ games had to be borne with laughter and good
  </p>
  <p>
   humor because they were just letting off steam in a youthful way. When he had lost
  </p>
  <p>
   hope, and also because he was jealous of the excessive love the dynast had for the
  </p>
  <p>
   boy, Styliolus rented a house in the farthest and most remote part of the city and went
  </p>
  <p>
   away to that place as if in exile. Styliolus had hardly set foot outside the dynast’s house
  </p>
  <p>
   when the boy took over the rooms in the most important wing of the villa, which had
  </p>
  <p>
   belonged to Styliolus, shutting the former occupant out of them forever.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the more influence the young man gained day by day in authority and favor,
  </p>
  <p>
   the more arrogantly and haughtily he behaved. He took his arrogance so far that once
  </p>
  <p>
   during lunch, when he was lying next to the dynast and was not eating anything besides
  </p>
  <p>
   fish (the practice from the ancient religion of those people held that meat was not to be
  </p>
  <p>
   eaten that day), it came about, perhaps because the sea was greatly agitated, that
  </p>
  <p>
   hardly any fish had been caught, and that any fish that had been caught were highly
  </p>
  <p>
   prized. Utterly common types of seafood were therefore set before him, like sardines,
  </p>
  <p>
   sole, and mussels. The master of the feast, however, saw to it that a pound of catfish,
  </p>
  <p>
   purchased at a very dear price, was placed before the dynast. Once the dynast had
  </p>
  <p>
   tasted it first and found it to have been agreeably and correctly prepared, he gave it to
  </p>
  <p>
   the young man out of esteem and love. Get a load of the impertinence and impudence
  </p>
  <p>
   of this man. Many distinguished noblemen were standing around the dining couch, hats
  </p>
  <p>
   off, waiting for their chief’s command and ready to do his bidding. The young man,
  </p>
  <p>
   511
  </p>
  <p>
   puffed up with foolish and ignorant arrogance, threw that very expensive food to the
  </p>
  <p>
   dogs, in front of everyone. Those who were present were amazed, turned white as a
  </p>
  <p>
   sheet, and trembled with fear. The dynast fell silent and made no sign of
  </p>
  <p>
   acknowledgment regarding the young man’s great offense. In response to the young
  </p>
  <p>
   man’s having greatly insulted and disdained his gift, the dynast remarked that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   behaved even more arrogantly that past summer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to avoid the summer heat, the dynast had retreated to his country estate
  </p>
  <p>
   near the city with his brother-in-law Megalobulus, who held many small towns under
  </p>
  <p>
   monarchical rule, so they could be together there. He did not bring anyone with him,
  </p>
  <p>
   except for a few servants and the young man, who slept in the anteroom at night like a
  </p>
  <p>
   bodyguard. But, in the dead of night and unbeknownst to everyone, the young man got
  </p>
  <p>
   up and galloped to the city on a horse. A short while later, the dynast woke up and
  </p>
  <p>
   asked for his chamber pot, but nobody came. He called for the young man by name, but
  </p>
  <p>
   no one responded. He called out a second and third time. Nothing. Then he jumped
  </p>
  <p>
   down from his bed and woke up the servant, who was sleeping alone in the other room,
  </p>
  <p>
   ordered him to carry a lamp, and together they searched, investigated, and found that
  </p>
  <p>
   the house had opened its doors like jaws and disgorged the young man outside. The
  </p>
  <p>
   house was not able contain him because he was enflamed by desire and eager to break
  </p>
  <p>
   free. There was a din, and other people ran over to let them know that the young man
  </p>
  <p>
   had mounted a horse and had raced to the city at a gallop to fulfill his desires. This
  </p>
  <p>
   pained the dynast greatly because, when the young man left, he had not locked the
  </p>
  <p>
   door but had left it wide open. It would have been within the power of any enemy or thief
  </p>
  <p>
   to approach right up to his bed and to smother him in his sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
   512
  </p>
  <p>
   Furious, Vius summoned his brother-in-law Megalobulus and told him about the
  </p>
  <p>
   young man’s wicked deed. Moreover, he said that this wasn’t to be tolerated and that
  </p>
  <p>
   they must see to it that the young man fully comprehend the significance of making a
  </p>
  <p>
   mockery of important men. Most of all, it bothered Megalobulus that his brother-in-law’s
  </p>
  <p>
   reputation was being damaged by the spiteful talk of those who did not have his best
  </p>
  <p>
   interest at heart, because the young men who basked in the dynast’s favor held too
  </p>
  <p>
   much sway. Because of his brother-in-law’s superior position, Megalobulus had never
  </p>
  <p>
   before dared to warn him about avoiding such disgrace, and he immediately seized this
  </p>
  <p>
   opportunity that was presented to him, exhorting the dynast not to entrust his life and his
  </p>
  <p>
   reputation to these immoral commoners. He said that he himself had three children,
  </p>
  <p>
   outstanding in both beauty and age, whose active and faithful services the dynast could
  </p>
  <p>
   benefit from, if he so desired. He said that they were devoted, beholden, and dedicated
  </p>
  <p>
   to him. As for the rest, he said that he himself would take responsibility for making sure
  </p>
  <p>
   that great insults such as these, and others, would not continue at this rate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Megalobulus left the dynast’s side intent on locating four strong men skilled in striking
  </p>
  <p>
   and beating; acting like purveyors,235 they would supply the young man with so much
  </p>
  <p>
   wood when they caught up with him that he would not be able to get out of bed for three
  </p>
  <p>
   months straight. Megalobulus did not have to look very far, since four members of the
  </p>
  <p>
   dynast’s own household, whom the young man had cruelly ordered about, had taken
  </p>
  <p>
   upon themselves this very task of beating him up. They knew he would be back, and so,
  </p>
  <p>
   instead of a banquet, they concocted an unwelcome surprise for him upon his arrival.
  </p>
  <p>
   235 The Latin is parochus (from the Greek πάροχος), a person who, for a certain sum, furnished traveling
  </p>
  <p>
   magistrates with necessities such as wood, beds, hay, straw, salt, etc. Wood in this sense means the
  </p>
  <p>
   instrument with which to beat someone, or, metonymically, a beating.
  </p>
  <p>
   513
  </p>
  <p>
   The young man returned with his mind very much at ease, entered the atrium of
  </p>
  <p>
   the house, and went straight up to the dynast who was passing the afternoon hours with
  </p>
  <p>
   Megalobulus in pleasant conversation. The men, with clubs at the ready, waited for the
  </p>
  <p>
   signal to bludgeon the man’s head, shoulders, and arms. But what do you think
  </p>
  <p>
   happened? Do you think the dynast ordered them to attack the young man, or at least
  </p>
  <p>
   scold him severely and remove him from his sight? Or, if he chose not to get angry, to
  </p>
  <p>
   nevertheless look disapprovingly upon him, so the young man would understand how
  </p>
  <p>
   displeased he was? Of course not! Then what did he do? The dynast rushed headlong
  </p>
  <p>
   into the young man’s arms, rejoiced at his arrival, and said: “Today we are having
  </p>
  <p>
   watermelon for lunch. I do not recall ever having eaten a watermelon before today that
  </p>
  <p>
   had a better shape or sweeter juices than this one. Do you want to try it?” “I don’t mind if
  </p>
  <p>
   I do!” The dynast called the server over and said: “Bring me the part of the watermelon
  </p>
  <p>
   that I had ordered to be served at dinner and bring back with you a jug of our very best
  </p>
  <p>
   chilled wine.” “As you command,” said the server.” “Carefully,” the dynast said, “and
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly. Have you understood your instructions?” The server did not delay. He brought
  </p>
  <p>
   the watermelon to the table and, once he had set it down, the dynast cut it up with his
  </p>
  <p>
   own hands and placed it before the young man. He then ladled out the wine, filled the
  </p>
  <p>
   wine glasses himself, and bade the young man drink and restore his strength that he
  </p>
  <p>
   had lost during his journey. Shaken by this, Megalobulus immediately got in his carriage
  </p>
  <p>
   and returned to his castle.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, while he was chatting like this, we walked up to a town situated
  </p>
  <p>
   in an elevated and pretty place. It had a very large town square, beautiful fountains, and
  </p>
  <p>
   many wide streets that continued throughout and were divided up by many streets
  </p>
  <p>
   514
  </p>
  <p>
   crossing it at right angles, and which contained a great many ornate private homes. But
  </p>
  <p>
   while he was talking, time had never seemed to pass so slowly as it did while he was
  </p>
  <p>
   finishing up his story. We were anxious to discover what the nature of that place was,
  </p>
  <p>
   what its traditions were, and what kinds of people lived there, and we heard that the
  </p>
  <p>
   land was extremely fertile for growing everything that was necessary to live, like wine,
  </p>
  <p>
   oil, and wheat. We heard that the people were very peaceful and dutiful and were so
  </p>
  <p>
   averse to thievery that, if any money accidentally falls out of anyone’s pocket, nobody
  </p>
  <p>
   bends over to pick it up. Moreover, we heard that they are so fond of, and love guests
  </p>
  <p>
   and foreigners so much, that it is considered akin to an inexpiable crime to dishonor or
  </p>
  <p>
   to lay a hand on them. When we learned these things, the idea came to us (if what they
  </p>
  <p>
   were saying was true) to remain there and not seek out any other regions or face the
  </p>
  <p>
   dangers of the sea again (which we later learned, from their conversations, had grown
  </p>
  <p>
   somewhat greater). We therefore decided to set up residence and establish our home
  </p>
  <p>
   there and to spend our remaining years in that place, for however long that may be.
  </p>
  <p>
   We were fortified in this new plan we had settled on by the words of that
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher, who condemned the crimes of desire with his verses. He said that
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone was equal under the law there and that nobody was granted more than
  </p>
  <p>
   anyone else; it was really the case that everyone was just about equal, and nobody
  </p>
  <p>
   surpassed anyone else in position and wealth. This was something that the philosopher
  </p>
  <p>
   identified as the most important ingredient for happiness, and he also affirmed that
  </p>
  <p>
   arrogance and injustice on the part of more powerful people was intolerable. He knew
  </p>
  <p>
   what he was talking about, because he had been caught up more than once in the
  </p>
  <p>
   unjust actions of powerful people, and, most of all, because, although he deserved to be
  </p>
  <p>
   515
  </p>
  <p>
   treated well by several prominent men (whose names he did not conceal), he had been
  </p>
  <p>
   very badly repaid. Thus, he began another song:
  </p>
  <p>
   It is worthwhile learning the habits of the rich man, namely what vices
  </p>
  <p>
   render his whole class weak. Sicknesses of the soul take hold of him and
  </p>
  <p>
   ruin his mind with a shameful wound—and not one of them is exempt.
  </p>
  <p>
   First, his puffed-up arrogance carries him off in a bronze carriage and
  </p>
  <p>
   inflates him, vain as he is, with bellows. Thus inflated, he does not stoop
  </p>
  <p>
   to show his arrogant face to a common man, one who is without wealth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Already he does not believe he was created from human flesh and blood,
  </p>
  <p>
   but that he is more akin to the gods in heaven; and he believes he has
  </p>
  <p>
   touched the blessed throne of eternal Jove. Because of this, he insists that
  </p>
  <p>
   near-divine honors be bestowed upon him, while he allows the poor man,
  </p>
  <p>
   with bared head and on bended knee, to pray for aid with gifts and
  </p>
  <p>
   entreaties. And not only does he rejoice in his reputation as a puffed-up,
  </p>
  <p>
   arrogant man, but he is consumed by much worse vices. His love of
  </p>
  <p>
   money grows, and his dark thirst for yellow metal236 rises up, attacks him,
  </p>
  <p>
   and settles deep within his core. How this desire for shameful greed burns
  </p>
  <p>
   his breast with fast-moving flames! How his desire for possessions blazes!
  </p>
  <p>
   While he unjustly amasses money for himself, snatched with impunity from
  </p>
  <p>
   a poor, trusting associate, and adding it to his own stockpile, he either
  </p>
  <p>
   defrauds poor craftsmen of agreed-upon wages or refuses to pay for
  </p>
  <p>
   things he has purchased. The complaints of the innocent cannot touch his
  </p>
  <p>
   savage heart, nor the tears heard in his echoing atrium, which his cheated
  </p>
  <p>
   creditor fills with mournful cries pleading: “Pay me what you owe me so I
  </p>
  <p>
   can keep cold and hunger at bay from my children and from my dear wife,
  </p>
  <p>
   lying ill in in tattered clothing, whom it often pains to make it through the
  </p>
  <p>
   day.” The cruel, rich man is happy to recline at an abundant dinner table
  </p>
  <p>
   surrounded by deep sighs and sorrowful complaints, and to compose
  </p>
  <p>
   musical concerts out of tears. What disgraceful and detestable desire
  </p>
  <p>
   does he not possess, which continuously swells his veins and, victorious
  </p>
  <p>
   over him, fills them up with a fast-moving heat until they are distended!
  </p>
  <p>
   Thus, no peace rests in his body or soul until he reaches his desired goal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Raging desire, driven by the burning Furies, is often transformed into
  </p>
  <p>
   anger, so long as he is aggrieved at not being able to get what he wants;
  </p>
  <p>
   or perceiving, with a sidelong glance, that other men are demanding that
  </p>
  <p>
   the loaf be divided in portions equal to his. Wherefore, a woman who does
  </p>
  <p>
   not wish to sell her virtue for cash or hastily acquiesces to the insane
  </p>
  <p>
   pleas of her lover, her windows are often spattered with a stinking mess,
  </p>
  <p>
   and her doorposts are broken with a ferocious hailstorm of rocks. And
  </p>
  <p>
   whoever goes forth boldly in search of the same sort of morsel, brings
  </p>
  <p>
   back a face ugly with the marks of infamy or a head and shoulders beaten
  </p>
  <p>
   with rigid sticks, or suffers an ugly death with savage wounds. Thus, love
  </p>
  <p>
   236 = gold
  </p>
  <p>
   516
  </p>
  <p>
   is mingled with the sword, as long as the spiteful person wishes to
  </p>
  <p>
   wantonly acquire what he desires without any competition.
  </p>
  <p>
   When we had heard these verses and had finished exploring the entire city, we rented a
  </p>
  <p>
   villa on a high hill,237 which, on one side, looked out onto the land, and, on the other
  </p>
  <p>
   side, looked out on the sea. At last, from the money we had brought with us, we
  </p>
  <p>
   purchased a farm to sustain ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   237 There are two possible interpretations for this villa on a high hill. If we read it only in the context of the
  </p>
  <p>
   1637 edition in eight books, it is plausible to see this as a reference Rossi’s own house on the Janiculum
  </p>
  <p>
   Hill, which he frequently mentions in his body of work. If we read it in the context of the 1645 edition in ten
  </p>
  <p>
   books, this could be a reference to Palazzo Barberini on the Quirinal. Book Nine opens with a long
  </p>
  <p>
   description of a grand villa with a splendid garden, which seems to represent a noble palace with a vast
  </p>
  <p>
   adjoining estate more than it does the simple farm described here.
